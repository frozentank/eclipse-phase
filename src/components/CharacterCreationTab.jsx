        "html": "There are two parts to every player character. The first is the sets of numbers and attributes that define what a character is good or bad at (or even what they can and can’t do) according to the game mechanics. These are more than just statistics, however—these characteristics help to define your character’s abilities and interests, and by extension their background, education, training, and experience. During the character creation process, you will have the ability to assign, adjust, and juggle these characteristics as you like. If you have a pre-conceived notion of what the character is about, you can optimize the stats to reflect that. Alternatively, you can tweak the stats until you get something you like, then base the character’s backstory off of what you develop.\nThe second part to every player character is their personality. What defines them as a person? What makes them tick? What pisses them off? What sparks their interest? What positive aspects of their personality make them appealing as a friend, comrade, or lover—or at least someone interesting to play? What character flaws and quirks do they have? These questions matter because they will also guide you as you assign stats, skills, and traits.\nCharacter generation is a step-by-step process. Unlike some games, the process for creating an Eclipse Phase character is not random—you have complete control over every aspect of your character’s design. Some stages must be completed before you can move on to others. The complete process is broken down on the Step-By-Step Guide to Character Creation sidebar."

        "html": "Deciding what/who you want to play before you make the character is usually the best route. Pick a simple archetype that fits your character, and work from there. Do you want to play an explorer? Someone sneaky, like a spy or thief? Someone cerebral, like a scientist? A hardened criminal or ex-cop? Or do you prefer to be a rabble-rousing agitator? You can also start with a personality type and choose an associated profession. If you want a social butterfly who excels at manipulating people, you can play a media personality, blogger, or party-going socialite. Perhaps you’d prefer a bottomedout reject with substance abuse problems, in which case an ex-merc or former hypercapitalist who lost his fortune and family during the Fall might fit. How about an energetic, live-life-to-the-fullest, must-see-it-all character? Then a habitat freerunner or professional gatecrasher might be what you’re looking for.\nMake sure to check in with the other players and try to create a character that’s complementary to the rest of the team—preferably one who provides some skill-set the group lacks. Why create a research archeologist if someone else is already set on playing one, especially when the team lacks a good combat specialist or async? On the other hand, if your team is going to be running an alien archeological expedition, then having more than one researcher (each with distinct areas of expertise) might not be bad.\nOnce you have the basic concept, try to fill it with a few more details, making it into a one-sentence summary. If you started with the concept of “xeno-so- ciologist,” expand it to “open-minded amateur linguist and expert xeno-sociologist who is fascinated by alien cultures, collects Factor kitsch, has a high-tolerance for ‘yuck factors,’ and whose best friends tend to be uplifts and AIs.” This will give you a few more details around which you can focus the character’s strengths and weaknesses."

Or did they start existence as a disembodied AI?\nYou must choose one of the backgrounds for your character from the list below. Choose wisely, as each background may provide your character with certain skills, traits, limitations, or other characteristics to start with. Keep in mind that your background is where you came from, not who you are now. It is the past, whereas your faction represents whom your character is currently aligned with. Your future, of course, is yours to make.\nThe background options presented below cover a wide selection of transhumanity, but they cannot cover every possibility. If your gamemaster allows it, you may work with them to develop a background that is not included on this list, using these as guidelines to keep it balanced.\nsubsubsectionDrifters\nYou were raised with a social grouping that remained on the move throughout the Sol system. This could have been free traders, pirates, asteroid farmers, scav- engers, or just migrant workers. You are used to roaming space travel between habitats and stations.\nAdvantages: +10 Navigation skill, +20 Pilot: Spacecraft skill, +10 Networking: [Field] skill of your choice\nDisadvantages: None\nCommon Morphs: All, especially Bouncers and Hibernoids\nsubsubsectionFall evacuee\nYou were born and raised on Earth and evacuated during the horrors of the Fall, leaving your old life (and possibly your friends, family, and loved ones) behind you.

Your very existence is illegal in certain habitats (a legacy of those who place the Fall at the feet of rampant AIs). Unlike the seed AIs responsible for their Fall, your capacity for self-improvement is limited, though you do have full autonomy.\nAdvantages: +30 Interfacing skill, Computer skills (Infosec, Interfacing, Programming, Research) bought with Customization Points are half price\nDisadvantages: Real World Naiveté trait, Social Stigma (AGI) trait, may not purchase Psi trait, Social skills bought with Customization Points are double price\nCommon Morphs: Infomorphs, synthetic morphs\nsubsubsectionIsolate\nYou were raised as part of a self-exiled grouping on the fringes of the system.

You believe power is always corrupting and everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect their lives.

She decides to create a salvage retrieval/scavenger type who started as a Lunar Colonist but is now a Brinker. Together, her background and faction give Tai +20 Networking: Autonomists skill, +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill, +10 Pilot: Spacecraft skill, and +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill. She also has +10 to two other skills (one Academic, Professional, or Technical) that she’ll choose later. Tai starts with 105 points for aptitudes, which works out to 15 each. She wants her character to be impulsive and antisocial, so right away she lowers both SAV and WIL to 10. She also wants to be smart and fast on her feet, so takes the extra 10 points that gives her and raises both COG and REF to 20. So her aptitudes are:\nbegincenter\nbegintabularccccccc\nCOG & COO & INT & REF & SAV & SOM & WIL <br/>\n20 & 15 & 15 & 20 & 10 & 15 & 10 <br/>\nendtabular\nendcenter\nShe marks down her Moxie of 1 and gets her native language (Chinese) at 85, both for free. Noting her 5,000 Credits, Tai divides her Rep score points evenly among @-rep and c-rep, taking 25 in each.\nTai now has 1,000 points to customize. She wants to be lucky, so she starts right off spending 60 (4 x 15) CP to raise her Moxie from 1 to 5. She also decides that she wants her character to be better at spotting things, so she raises her INT from 15 to 20, at a cost of 50 CP (5 x 10). So far, she’s spent 110 CP. She must buy at least 400 points of Active skills, so she tackles that next. She knows that skills are based on aptitudes and they get more expensive over 60, so she decides the most she’ll spend on any single skill is 40 (since her highest aptitude is 20). She picks out her skills, assigns the points, and adds them to the starting aptitudes. This is what she starts with, noting the points she spent on each and the total value (counting aptitude) in parentheses. Beam Weapons (COO) 30 (45), Climbing (SOM) 30 (45), Demolitions (COG) 40 (60), Fray (REF) 30 (50), Freefall (REF) 40 (60), Freerunning (SOM) 30 (45), Hardware: Aerospace (COG) 40 (60), Infiltration (COO) 30 (45), Interfacing (COG) 20 (40), Navigation (INT) 40 (60), Perception (INT) 40 (60), Persuasion (SAV) 20 (30), Research (COG) 20 (40), and Scrounging (INT) 40 (60). This costs her 450 CP, so she’s spent a total of 560 CP so far. Now she spends her 300 points of Knowledge skills: Academics: Astrophysics (COG) 40 (60), Academics: Engineering (COG) 40 (60), Academics: Fall History (COG) 40 (60), Art: Sculpture (INT) 40 (60), Interest: Brinker Stations (COG) 40 (60), Interest: Conspiracies (COG) 30 (50), Language: English (INT) 40 (60), Profes- sion: Appraisal (COG) 40 (60), Profession: Scavenger Trade (COG) 40 (60).\nThis costs her another 350 CP, bringing her total spent CP to 910.\nAdding in her background and faction skills, she also has Networking: Autonomists (SAV) 30, Networking: Hypercorps (SAV) 30, Pilot: Spacecraft (REF) 30 (50), Pilot: Groundcraft (REF) 30 (50). She takes the freebie +10 and adds it to Fray (raising it to 60) and applies the other +10 to Academics: Economics (COG) 30.\nWith 90 CP left, Tai moves on to Rep. Tai wants to have a lot of good connections, so she raises both of her Rep scores by 30 points each, at a cost of 6 CP. She also decides she needs some credibility with criminal types, so she buys g-rep at 40, for 4 more CP. Now she has 80 CP left.\nTai’s character needs a body, and she decides a bouncer is most suited for the nomadic, spacefaring lifestyle of her brinker. That costs another 40 CP, leaving her with 50 CP left to spend.\nLooking back at her skills, she decides to raise her Pilot: Spacecraft from 50 to 70. It costs her 10 CP to raise the skill to 60, and another 20 CP to raise it from 60 to 70, for a total cost of 30 CP. She also wants to raise her Scrounging from 60 to 70, for a 20 CP cost. That nicely uses up the last of her CP.\nScanning the traits, though, Tai also decides that Situational Awareness would be a good choice for her scavenger. At a cost of 10 CP, she would need to take another negative trait to compensate. She chooses Neural Damage (synaesthesia)—a condition she inherited from a rampaging nanovirus during the Fall.\nTai’s points are now all evened out and spent.\nendquotation\nsubsubsectionStarting Aptitudes\nYour character receives 105 free points to distribute among their 7 aptitudes: Cognition, Coordination, Intuition, Reflexes, Savvy, Somatics, and Willpower (see Aptitudes, p. 123). (That breaks down to an average of 15 per aptitude, so it may be easiest to give each 15 and then adjust accordingly, raising some and lowering others.) Each aptitude must be given at least 5 points (unless you take the Feeble trait, see p. 149), and no aptitude may be raised higher than 30 (unless you take the Exceptional Aptitude trait, p. 146). Note that certain morphs (flats and splicers, for example) may also put a cap on how high your aptitudes may be (see Aptitude Maximums, p. 124).\nFor simplicity, it is recommended that aptitude scores be handled as multiples of 5, but this is not a necessity.\nsubsubsectionNative Tongue\nEvery character receives their natural Language skill at a rating of 70 + INT for free. This skill may be raised with CP (see below).\nsubsubsectionStarting Moxie\nEvery character starts off with a Moxie stat of 1 (see Moxie, p. 122).\nsubsubsectionCredit\nAll characters are given 5,000 credits with which to purchase gear during character creation, unless you have the Fall Evacuee or Re-instantiated background (in which case you start with 2,500 or 0 credits, re- spectively). See Purchasing Gear, p. 136, for more details.\nsubsubsectionRep\nYour character isn’t a complete newbie. You get 50 rep points to divide between the reputation networks of your choice (see Reputation and Social Networks, p. 285)."

Each character is given 1,000 CP, which may be used to increase aptitudes, buy skills, acquire more Moxie, buy more credit, elevate your Rep, or purchase positive traits. You may also take on negative traits in order to get even more CP with which to customize your character. This customization process should be used to tweak your character and specialize them in the ways you desire.\nIf a gamemaster seeks a different level of gameplay, they can adjust this CP amount. If the gamemaster wants a scenario where the starting characters are younger or less experienced, they can lower the CP to 800 or even 700. On the other hand, if you want to create characters who start off as grizzled veterans, you can raise the CP to 1,100 or even 1,200.\nNot all customizations are equal - aptitudes, for example, are considerably more valuable than individual skills.

Skills are bought at the cost of 1 CP per point. Keep in mind that learned skills start at the rating of the linked aptitude. For example, if you want to raise a skill to 30 and the skill’s linked aptitude is 10, you’ll need to spend 20 CP. Skill bonuses from background or faction should also be applied to the rating before you start raising the skill. For simplicity, it is recommended that skills be purchased as multiples of 5, but this is not a necessity. Raising a skill over 60 is expensive. Each point over 60 costs double. Raising a skill with a linked attribute of 20 up to 70 would cost 60 CP: 40 points to get from 20 to 60, and 20 more points to get from 60 to 70. No learned skill may be raised over 80 during character creation (unless you have the Expert trait, p. 146). Though Knowledge skills are grouped into 5 skills, each is a field skill (p. 172), meaning that it can be taken multiple times with different fields. A complete list of skills can be found on p. 176.\nsubsubsectionSpecializations\nSpecializations (p. 173) may also be purchased at the cost of 5 CP per specialization. You may purchase specializations for both Active and Knowledge skills. Only 1 specialization may be purchased per skill, and they may only be bought for skills with a rating of 30+.\nsubsubsectionBuying More Credit\nIf you want more cred to spend on gear, every CP will get you 1,000 credits. See Purchase Gear, p. 136, for details on buying stuff. The maximum CP you can spend on additional credits is 100.\nsubsubsectionIncreasing Rep\nIf you want your character to start play with lots of social capital, you can increase your Rep score(s) at the cost of 1 CP per 10 additional points. No individual Rep score may be raised above 80, and the maximum amount of CP that may be spent on Rep is 35 points.\nsubsubsectionStarting Morph\nPerhaps the most important use of CP is to buy the morph with which your character begins play. This may be the original bodily form in which your character started life, or it may simply be the sleeve they are currently inhabiting. Available morphs are listed starting on p. 139. Note that any aptitude or skill bonuses provided by the morph are applied after all CP are spent. In other words, these bonuses do not affect the costs of buying aptitude and skill points during character generation. No aptitude may be modified over 40.\nsubsubsectionPurchasing Traits\nTraits represent specific qualities your character has that may help or hinder them. Positive traits supply bonuses in certain situations, and each has a listed CP cost. You may not spend more than 50 CP on positive traits. Negative traits inflict disadvantages on your character, but they also give you extra CP that you can spend on customizing your character. You may not purchase more than 50 CP worth of negative traits, and no more than 25 CP may be negative morph traits. Positive traits are listed on p. 145, negative traits on p. 148. Note that traits you receive from your background or faction do not cost or provide you with bonus CP. Traits listed as morph traits apply to the morph, and not the ego. If the character switches to a new morph, these traits are lost (and new morph traits may be gained). Morph traits may be bought like other traits during character generation.\nsubsubsectionPsi Sleights\nCharacters who purchase the Psi trait (p. 147) may spend CP to purchase sleights (see Sleights, p. 223). These represent specific psi abilities the character has learned. The cost to buy a sleight is 5 CP. No more than 5 psi-chi and 5 psi-gamma sleights may be bought during character creation. Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from sleights are treated as modifications; they are applied after all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of buying skills or aptitudes during character creation."

The average costs for each cost category should be used when calculating gear prices.     Every character starts off with one piece of gear for free: a standard muse (p. 332). This is the digital AI companion that the character has had since they were a child. Additionally, each character starts with 1 month of backup insurance (p. 330) at no cost.\nbegincenter\nbegintabular|c|c|c|\nhline\nmulticolumn3|c|Gear Costs <br/>\nhline\nCategory & Range (Credits) & Average (Credits)<br/>\nhline\nTrivial & 1-99 & 50<br/>\nhline\nLow & 100-499 & 250<br/>\nhline\nModerate & 500-1,499 & 1,000<br/>\nhline\nHigh & 1,500-9,999 & 5,000<br/>\nhline\nExpensive & 10,000+ & 20,000<br/>\nhline\nendtabular\nendcenter\nThere is no limitation other than what the gamemaster allows on what gear characters can and cannot buy during character creation. Both the players and gamemaster should keep the character’s background and faction in mind. Since some gear is likely very restricted in some habitats if not outright illegal, there needs to be a plausible explanation for who and how a character from such a place might have such gear. If there isn’t, then the gamemaster can choose not to allow it. The starting locale for a game should also be considered. A character from the restrictive Jovian Republic might have a hard time explaining how they have an illegal cornucopia machine back in the Republic, but if the game takes place on board a scum barge where everything is available and anything goes, then such an explanation becomes much easier.\nThe one exception to buying gear with Credit is the purchase of additional morphs. Characters may buy extra morphs during character creation, but they must be bought with CP. The player must choose one morph in which the character is sleeved. Extra morphs also require body bank service fees (p. 331).\nNote that any skill or aptitude bonuses from gear are treated as modifications; they are applied after all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of buying skills or aptitudes during character creation. %%% txt/140.txt"

These may be as specific “undermine the local triad boss” or as broad as “promote hypercapitalism,” and they may be short term or long term. Some sample motivations are provided on the Example Motivations table (p. 138). You should work with your gamemaster when choosing your motivations, as they can be used to propel the storyline forward and specific scenarios can be constructed around your character’s goals. Some of your character’s motivations may change later (see Changing Motivation, p. 152). Motivations will help your character regain Moxie (p. 122) and earn extra Rez Points during gameplay (p. 384).\nMotivations should be listed on your character sheet as a single term or short phrase, along with a + or - symbol to denote whether they support or oppose it.

Your character’s Background is a good place to start as it says where they came, but it could be expanded. What did they think of their childhood? Do they still have ties from there? How did they move from such origins to the Faction they are part of? Are they fully supportive of their Faction’s goals, or are they in opposition? How does the character view other Factions?\nNext, take a look at the skills and other defining points—these also tell a story. How did they acquire those skills? Why? How did they develop their Rep score (or lack of one)? How did they get connected with the groupings represented by their Networking skills? What do the character’s traits say about them? How did they get their current morph? Is it their original? If not, what happened to their first body? Also taking into account the major factor of Motivations, all of these questions will help you build a de- fining picture of your character. Not everything about your character needs to be filled out, of course—it’s ok to leave a few blanks that you can fill in later. Assembling the points you have deduced so far will help you to present your character as a whole, unique individual, however, rather than just a blank template. As a final step, take a few minutes to pick out some specific identifying features and personality quirks that will help you define the character to others. This could be a way of talking, a strongly-projected attitude, a catchphrase they use frequently, a unique look or style of dress, a repetitive behavior, an annoying mannerism, or anything else similar that is easy to latch onto. Such idiosyncrasies give something that other players can latch onto, spurring roleplaying opportunities."

        "title": "Synthetic Morphs",
        "html": "Synthetic morphs are completely artificial/robotic. They are usually operated by AIs or via remote control, but the lack of available biomorphs after the Fall meant that many infugees resorted to resleeving in robotic shells, which were also cheaper, quicker to manufacture, and more widely available. Nevertheless, synthmorphs are viewed with disdain in many habitats, an option that only the poor and desperate accept to be sleeved in. Synthetic morphs are not without with their advantages, however, and so are commonly used for menial labor, heavy labor, habitat construction, and security services.\nAll synthmorphs have the following advantages:\nbeginitemize\n• Lack of Biological Functions. Synthmorphs need not be bothered with trivialities like breathing, eating, defecating, aging, sleeping, or any similar minor but crucial aspects of biological life.\n• Pain Filter. Synthmorphs can filter out their pain receptors, so that they are unhampered by wounds or physical damage. This allows them to ignore the -10 modifier from 1 wound (see Wound Effects, p. 207), but they suffer -30 on any tactile-based Perception Tests and will not even notice they have been damaged unless they succeed in a (modified) Perception Test.\n• Immunity to Shock Weapons. Synthmorphs have no nervous system to disrupt, and their optical electronics are carefully shielded from interfer- ence. Shock attacks may temporarily disrupt their wireless radio communications, however, for the duration of the attack.\n• Environmental Durability. Synthmorphs are built to withstand a wide range of environments, from dusty Mars to the oceans of Europa to the vacuum of space. They are unaffected by any but the most extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressures. Treat as Temperature Tolerance (p. 305) and Vacuum Sealing (p. 305).\n• Toughness. Synthetic shells are made to last—a fact reflected in their higher Durability and built-in Armor ratings.

Though many varieties of case bot models exist, they are uniformly regarded as shoddy and inferior. Most case morphs are vaguely anthromorphic, with a thin framework body, standing just shorter than an average human, and suffer from frequent malfunctions.\nbegindescription*\n• [Enhancements] Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Mnemonic Augmentation\n• [Mobility System] (Movement Rate) Walker (4/16)\n• [Aptitude Maximum] 20\n• [Durability] 20\n• [Wound Threshold] 4\n• [Advantages] Armor (4/4)\n• [Disadvantages] -5 to one chosen aptitude, Lemon trait, Social Stigma (Clanking Masses) trait\n• [CP Cost] 5\n• [Credit Cost] Moderate\nenddescription*\nsubsubsectionSynth\nSynths are anthromorphic robotic shells (androids and gynoids). They are typically used for menial labor jobs where pods are not as good of an option. Cheaper than many other morphs, they are commonly used for people who need a morph quickly and cheaply or simply on a transient basis. Though they look humanoid, synths are easily recognizable as non-biological unless they have the synthetic mask option (p. 311).\nbegindescription*\n• [Enhancements] Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Mnemonic Augmentation\n• [Mobility System] Walker (4/20)\n• [Aptitude Maximum] 30\n• [Durability] 40\n• [Wound Threshold] 8\n• [Advantages] +5 SOM, +5 to one other aptitude of the player’s choice, Armor 6/6\n• [Disadvantages] Social Stigma (Clanking Masses) trait, Uncanny Valley trait\n• [CP Cost] 30\n• [Credit Cost] High\nenddescription*\nsubsubsectionArachnoids\nArachnoid robotic shells are 1-meter in length, segmented into two parts, with a smaller head, like a spider or termite. They feature four pairs of 1.5-meter- long retractable arms/legs, capable of rotating around the axis of the body, with built-in hydraulics for propelling the bot with small leaps. The manipulator claws on each arm/leg can be switched out with extendable mini-wheels for high-speed skating movement. A smaller pair of manipulator arms near the head allows for closer handling and tool use. In zero-G environments, arachnoids can retract their arms/legs and maneuver with vectored air thrusters.\nbegindescription*\n• [Enhancements] Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Enhanced Vision, Extra Limbs (6 Arms/Legs), Lidar, Mnemonic Augmentation, Pneumatic Limbs, Radar\n• [Mobility System] Walker (4/24), Thrust Vector (8/40)\n• [Aptitude Maximum] 30\n• [Durability] 40\n• [Wound Threshold] 8\n• [Advantages] +5 COO, +10 SOM, Armor 8/8\n• [CP Cost] 45\n• [Credit Cost] Expensive (minimum 40,000+)\nenddescription*\nsubsubsectionDragonfly\nThe dragonfly robotic morph takes the shape of a meter-long flexible shell with multiple wings and manipulator arms.

Their core frame consists of a half-dozen interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multilegged walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others. Each module features its own sensor units and “bush robot” fractal-branching digits (each capable of breaking into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbot control computer is also distributed between modules. Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics assembly, and so on.\nbegindescription*\n• [Enhancements] Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Fractal Digits, Mnemonic Augmentation, Modular Design, Shape Adjusting\n• [Mobility System] Walker (4/16), Hover (8/40)\n• [Aptitude Maximum] 30\n• [Durability] 25\n• [Wound Threshold] 5\n• [Advantages] Armor 4/4\n• [CP Cost] 20\n• [Credit Cost] Expensive (minimum 30,000+)\nenddescription*\nsubsubsectionReaper\nThe reaper is a common combat bot, used in place of biomorph soldiers and typically operated via teleoperation or by autonomous AI. The reaper’s core form is an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. It uses vector thrust nozzles to maneuver in microgravity, and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance. Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. The reaper’s shell is made of smart materials, allowing these limbs and weapon mounts to extrude in any direction desired and even to change shape and length. In gravity environments, the reaper walks or hops on two or four of these limbs. Reapers are infamous due to numerous war XPs, and bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows, if not get you arrested.\nbegindescription*\n• [Enhancements] 360-Degree Vision, Access Jacks, Anti-Glare, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Cyber Claws, Extra Limbs (4), Heavy Combat Armor, Magnetic System, Pneumatic Limbs, Puppet Sock, Radar, Reflex Booster, Shape Adjusting, Structural Enhancement, T-Ray Emitter, Weapon Mount (Articulated, 4)\n• [Mobility System] Walker (4/20), Hopper (4/20), Ionic (12/40), Vectored Thrust (4/20)\n• [Aptitude Maximum] 40\n• [Speed Modifier] +1 (Reflex Booster)\n• [Durability] 50 (60 with Structural Enhancement)\n• [Wound Threshold] 10 (12 w/Structural Enhancement)\n• [Advantages] 4 Limbs, +5 COO, +10 REF (+20 with Reflex Booster), +10 SOM, Armor 16/16\n• [CP Cost] 100\n• [Credit Cost] Expensive (minimum 50,000+)\nenddescription*\nsubsubsectionSlitheroids\nSlitheroid bots are synthetic shells taking the form of a 2-meter-long segmented metallic snake, with two retractable arms for tool use.

Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The controlling computer and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a unit. Individual bugs are quite capable of interfacing with electronics.\nbegindescription*\n• [Enhancements] Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Mnemonic Augmentation, Swarm Composition\n• [Mobility System] Walker (2/8), Hopper (4/20), Rotor (4/32)\n• [Aptitude Maximum] 30\n• [Durability] 30\n• [Wound Threshold] 6\n• [Advantages] See Swarm Composition (p. 311)\n• [Disadvantages] See Swarm Composition (p. 311)\n• [CP Cost] 25\n• [Credit Cost] Expensive\nenddescription*"

Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major:\n<strong>Minor:</strong> A minor addiction is largely kept under control—it does not ruin the character’s life, though it may create some difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have a problem. The character must indulge the addiction at least once a week, though they can go for longer without too much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose, they suffer a -10 modifier on all actions until they get their fix.\n<strong>Moderate:</strong> A moderate addiction is in full swing.

A number of educational resources are freely available via the mesh, though some areas of interest may be restricted or hard to fi nd. This can be handled via roleplaying or designated as something the character is doing during downtime between sessions. If the gamemaster decides that a character has not put enough effort into improving a skill, they may call for more practice/study. The cost to increase a skill is 1 RP per skill point, and no skill may be increased over 99. No skill may be raised by more than 5 points per month.

In the case of a positive trait, the character must immediately spend Rez Points equal to the trait’s CP cost for the privilege (whether they wanted the new trait or not). If the character has no unspent RP available, they must pay out immediately from any future RP they earn until the debt is paid off. In the case of a negative trait, however, the character is simply saddled with the new fl aw—they do not acquire any extra RP for gaining the negative trait. Getting rid of traits is somewhat more diffi cult. Positive traits may be lost due to unfortunate effects on the character, as the gamemaster sees fi t. Such lost positive traits are simply gone—the character does not receive any Rez Point reimbursement. Negative traits are occasionally eliminated in the same way, but more typically they can only be worked off through the hard work and diligence of a character that seeks to overcome their handicap. Such endeavors should require weeks if not months of effort on the character’s part, with appropriate roleplaying and possibly some diffi cult tests. In fact, overcoming such traits could be the source of an adventure. Once a gamemaster feels that the character has made a strong-enough effort, the character may pay a number of Rez Points equal to the trait’s original CP bonus to negate it.
