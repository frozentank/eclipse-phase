        "html": "Aptitudes represent inherent skills and abilities acquired\nat birth or during the course of growing up. Aptitudes\nare sometimes used for tests, but their primary use is\ndetermining the starting point at which learned skills\nare developed. Aptitudes determine the starting value\nof their linked skills. For example, a character with\nSomatics aptitude 10 who wishes to purchase points\nin the Freerunning skill (which is linked to Somatics)\nwould start with a Freerunning rank of 10 and then\nbuy additionally points in that skill.\nAptitudes are also used when a character doesn’t\nposses knowledge of a needed skill (see Defaulting, p.\n116). Aptitudes represent the basic knowledge that a\ncharacter has acquired regarding rudimentary use of that\nskill. They may not have ever received any formal training\nwith the skill, but they can still attempt to use it.\nAptitudes range in value from 1 to 30, with 10 being\nthe unaugmented human average and 15 representing\nthe average of most genetically modified transhumans.\nSince aptitudes represent untrained ability, they are\ncapped at a maximum rating of 30.\nThere are seven different aptitudes that all players\npossess. These aptitudes are purchased during character\ncreation (p. 128), but depending on the morph the\ncharacter is currently inhabiting, they may find their aptitudes\ncapped by the quality of the morph (see p. 124).\nsubsubsectionLEARNED SKILLS\nA player’s learned skills are the most important part of\ntheir character, representing the acquired knowledge\nthey carry with them from morph to morph, knowledge\nthat plays a fundamental role in helping define\nthe person’s ego. Learned skills encompass nearly any\nskill that you might need to use in Eclipse Phase, and\nthey range in value from 0 to 99.\nAll learned skills have a linked aptitude that is\nused to calculate their initial value, and which is\nalso defaulted to if the player does not have that\nparticular skill.\nsubsubsectionSKILL CATEGORIES\nEach learned skill is classified as either an Active skill\nor a Knowledge skill. Active skills represent skills\nthat typically require physical actions and are used in\naction scenes within game play. Knowledge skills are\nmore knowledge-based and intellectual, representing\nideas and facts. Knowledge skills may play a less dramatic role in certain action-oriented game play moments, but they flesh out the character’s background\nand interests and are integral to roleplaying interactions. Active and Knowledge skills are purchased\nseparately during character creation.\nActive skills are further divided into Combat,\nMental, Physical, Psi, Social, Technical, and Vehicle\nskills. Certain traits and abilities may apply to specific\ncategories.\nsubsubsectionFIELD SKILLS\nSome learned skills are field skills, meaning that when\nthis skill is chosen a particular field of emphasis must\nalso be selected. For example, the skill of Academics\nrequires the character to specify a specific academic\ndiscipline in which they are knowledgeable, such as\nBiology, Chemistry, or Xenosociology. Field skills are\nwritten as “[skill]: [field];” for example: “Art: Painting.” Field skills can be taken multiple times, choosing\na different area of emphasis each time, reflecting skills\nin different fields; that is to say, each field is a separate\nskill. Several suggested fields are listed for each field\nskill, but gamemasters and players may also cooperate\nto create others that fit their games.\nField skills may also have specializations; for example, Professional: Accounting (Money Laundering).\nsubsubsectionPSI SKILLS\nPsi refers to the ability to perceive and manipulate\nbiological minds via psi waves and/or other inexplicable phenomena. Due to the uniqueness of this ability,\ncharacters that wish to wield psi must acquire the Psi\n%%% txt/175.txt\ntrait (p. 147). Psi use also requires a number of specialized skills (Control, Psi Assault, and Sense) that reflect\nspecial training characters acquire to tap into their psi\npowers. Psi skills may not be defaulted on; the only\nway to use a psi skill is to possess the trait along with\ntraining in that skill. For more details, see Psi, p. 220.\nsubsubsectionSPECIALIZATIONS\nAny character may opt to specialize in a given skill\n(see Specializations, p. 123). This specialization reflects\nincreased knowledge in one particular aspect of the\nskill. Many of the skills offered below include sample\nspecializations. Gamemasters and players are encouraged to develop other specialization ideas together for\ntheir campaigns.\nSpecialization provides a +10 modifier when\nusing that skill in a situation appropriate to that\nspecialization."

        "html": "Whenever a character wants to do something using\na skill, they must succeed at a skill test (see Making\nTests, p. 115). The difficulty of the action is applied\nas a modifier, as are any other extenuating circumstances that may affect the test (see Difficulty and\nModifiers, p. 115). As with other types of tests, all skill\ntests are successful when the character rolls less than\nor equal to the test’s target number after any modifiers have been applied. In the case of skill tests, the\ntarget number is the character’s skill rating with that\nparticular skill. Modifiers representing difficulty and\nother factors are applied directly to the target number\n(see Difficulty and Modifiers, p. 115). A roll of a 00 is\nalways a success, regardless of modifiers, and a result\nof 99 is always a failure, again despite any modifiers\nthat may increase a character’s target number over\n100. Standard critical success and failure rules apply\nto skill tests (see Criticals: Rolling Doubles, p. 116),\nso any time a character rolls a double (i.e. 00, 11, 22,\n33, etc.) they score a critical success or failure.\nsubsubsectionDEFAULTING\nSometimes you lack the skill needed in a certain situation. In these instances, characters may default their\nskill test to the linked aptitude. This reflects the fact\nthat most learned skills are developed from some sort\nof baseline physical ability. Even though you may not\nknow how to do something, you’ve likely seen how\nit’s done at some point or have some idea of how to\ndo it, or can at least take a shot at it. Naturally, you’re\nnot as good as someone who has training in that skill,\nbut it still allows you to make an attempt.\nNot all skills can be defaulted. Some skills are\nsimply too complex or obscure, or demand special\nknowledge or ability, for someone to attempt their\nuse untrained. For example, brain surgery or most psi\nskills are simply beyond anyone who doesn’t have that\nability or the knowledge of what they’re attempting.\nsubsubsectionDEFAULTING TO FIELD SKILLS\nIn some cases, a character may not possess the particular field skill that a test calls for, but they may be\nskilled in another related field. For example, a test to\nconduct an alien autopsy might call for an Academics:\nXenobiology roll, but a character who doesn’t have\nthat skill may be allowed to default to Academics:\nBiology instead. The gamemaster decides if and when\nto allow this, perhaps applying a modifier to the test\nbased on the difference between fields.\nsubsubsectionDEFAULTING TO RELATED SKILLS\nIf the gamemaster allows it, characters may default to\na related skill that also has some relevance to the test\nat hand. For example, a character skilled in Kinetic\nWeapons might not be trained in the use of a laser, but\nthey know enough to point at the target and pull the\ntrigger. Likewise, a character might not be skilled in\nInvestigation, but the gamemaster could still allow\nthem to use their Perception skill instead in order to\nrealize that a body had been moved from the place\nwhere it had been shot. In situations like this, when the\ngamemaster allows defaulting to a related skill, a –30\nmodifier should be applied to the test.\nbeginquotation\n<strong>Example</strong>\n<br/>\nSrit is wandering through a black market souk on\nMars, trying to find a particular piece of sensory\nequipment. The gamemaster calls for a Scrounging\nTest, but Srit does not have that skill. She could\ndefault her INT of 22, but instead she asks the\ngamemaster if she can default to the related skill\nof Perception, which she has at 82. The gamemaster agrees, and so Srit rolls against a target number\nof 52 (82 – 30).\nendquotation\nsubsubsectionCOMPLEMENTARY SKILLS\nSometimes more than one skill may apply to a particular test, or knowledge in one area can aid your skill\nin another. In this case, the gamemaster may apply a\nmodifier to the skill test based on the strength of the\ncomplementing skill, as noted on the Complementary\nSkill Bonus table.\nbeginquotation\n<strong>Example</strong>\n<br/>\nDav is hoping to persuade a brinker pilot to take him\nto an isolated habitat that doesn’t welcome visitors.\nTo impress upon the pilot that he is a friend of these\nparticular isolates, he calls on his knowledge of their\nparticular cultural practices (Interests: Religious\nCults skill at 45). The gamemaster allows this and\napplies a +20 modifier to Dav’s Persuasion Test.\nendquotation\nbeginquotation\n<strong>COMPLEMENTARY SKILL BONUS</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbegintabularcc\nSKILL RATING & MODIFIER <br/>\n01-30 & +10 <br/>\n31-60 & +20 <br/>\n61+ & +30 <br/>\nendtabular\nendquotation\nbeginquotation\n<strong>APTITUDE RANGE</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbegintabularlllll\nRATING & ASSESSMENT & SOMATICS & COORDINATION & REFLEXES <br/>\n1–5 & child average & inept & clumsy & slow <br/>\n6–10 & adult average & weak & able & paced <br/>\n11–15 & transhuman average & fit & coordinated & swift <br/>\n16–20 & enhanced & enhanced & agile & fast <br/>\n21–25 & superhuman & gifted & nimble & lightning <br/>\n26-30 & posthuman & elite & unerring & synaptic <br/>\n%endtabular\n%<br/>\n%begintabularccccccccc\n<br/>\nRATING & COGNITION & INTUITION & SAVVY & WILLPOWER <br/>\n1–5 & limited & aware & awkward & distracted <br/>\n6–10 & intelligent & perceptive & personable & controlled <br/>\n11–15 & bright & sharp & charismatic & focused <br/>\n16–20 & learned & uncanny & dazzling & resolute <br/>\n21–25 & brilliant & prescient & mesmerizing & unwavering <br/>\n26-30 & genius & near omniscient & hypnotic & unshakable <br/>\nendtabular\nendquotation"

This should only\noccur when no learned skills are appropriate to the\ntest, and these circumstances are usually noted in\nthe rules.\nAptitude-only tests must be handled carefully, as\nthe range of aptitude ratings (1–30) is typically much\nsmaller than the rating of learned skills (0–99). For\nthis reason, most aptitude tests should use a target\nnumber equal to the aptitude x 3. In rare cases where\nthe test is more difficult, the gamemaster may simply\nuse an aptitude x 2, or just the straight aptitude rating.\nIn some cases, more than one aptitude may be relevant\nto the test, and so they may be added together\nto derive the target number.\nWhat follows are a few examples where an aptitudeonly\ntest might be appropriate. Gamemasters may call\nfor similar tests in other situations, but learned skills\nshould be used whenever possible.\nbeginquotation\n<strong>APTITUDE COMPARISON: FLATS VS.

The majority of people,\nhowever, inhabit bodies that are known as splicers (p. 139) or exalts (p. 139) (well, those with biological bodies\nanyway). Splicers are genefixed to avoid genetic defects and optimized for certain characteristics, while exalts\nare tweaked to make them superior across the board: they are more attractive, more athletic, have greater\ncognitive capacity, and are more attuned to the world around them than their unaugmented kin.\nendquotation"

Most theoretical and\napplied sciences, social sciences, transhumanities,\netc. are covered by this skill. Most of the other\nskills listed in this chapter could also be taken as\nan Academics field, reflecting a working theoretical\nknowledge of the skill—for example, Academics:\nArmorer or Academics: Interrogation.\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> Academics is used when a\ncharacter wishes to call upon a specific body of\nknowledge. For example, Academics: Chemistry\ncould be used to identify a particular substance,\nunderstand an unusual chemical reaction, or determine\nwhat elements are needed to nanofabricate\nsomething that requires exotic materials. At the\ngamemaster’s discretion, some Academics-related\ntests might not be defaultable, given that only\nsomeone who has been educated in that subject is\nlikely to be able to tackle it.\n<br/> <strong>Sample Fields:</strong> Archeology, Astrobiology, Astronomy,\nAstrophysics, Astrosociology, Biochemistry,\nBiology, Botany, Computer Science,\nCryptography, Economics, Engineering, Genetics,\nGeology, Linguistics, Mathematics, Memetics,\nNanotechnology, Old Earth History, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, Xeno-archeology,\nXenolinguistics, Zoology\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> As appropriate to the field\nsubsubsectionANIMAL HANDLING\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Social\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> SAV\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> Skilled animal handlers are able to\ntrain and control a wide variety of natural and transgenic animals, including partial uplifts. Though many\nanimal species went extinct during the Fall, a few\n“ark” and zoo habitats keep some species alive, and\nmany others can be resurrected from genetic samples.\nExotic animals are considered a sign of prestige\namong the hypercorp elites, and guard animals are\noccasionally used to protect high-security installations.\nLikewise, many habitats and settlements employ small\narmies of partially uplifted, genetically modified, and\nbehavior-controlled creatures for sanitation or other\npurposes. Many new and strange breeds of animal are\ncreated daily to serve a variety of roles.\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> Animal Handling is used whenever\nyou are trying to manipulate an animal, whether your\nintent is to calm it down, keep it from attacking, intimidate it, acquire its trust, or goad it into attacking.\nYour Margin of Success determines how effective you\nare at convincing the creature. At the gamemaster’s\ndiscretion, modifiers may be applied to the test. Likewise, winning an animal over may sometimes take\ntime, and so could be handled as a Task Action with a\ntimeframe of five minutes or more.\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Per animal species (dogs, horses, smart\nrats, etc.)\nbeginquotation\n<strong>TRAINING ANIMALS</strong>\n<br/>\nTraining animals is a time-consuming task requiring\nrepeated efforts and rewards to reinforce the trained\nbehavior. Treat this as a Task Action with a timeframe\nof one day to one month, depending on the complexity of the action. Apply modifiers to this test based on\nthe relative intelligence of the animal being trained,\nhow domestic it is, and the complexity of the task.\nOnce an animal has been trained, commanding\nit is treated as a Simple Success Test (p. 118) except\nfor unusual or stressful situations, in which case the\ntrainer receives a +30 modifier on their Animal Handling Tests when convincing the animal to complete\nthe trained action.\nendquotation\nsubsubsectionART: [FIELD]\n<strong>Type:</strong> Field, Knowledge\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> INT\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> Art confers the ability to create and evaluate artistic endeavors. This is a particularly useful\nskill in Eclipse Phase, especially in the post-scarcity\neconomies where creativity and vision can be a key\ncomponent to a character’s reputation.\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> The Art skill can be used to either\ncreate a new work of art or to duplicate an existing\npiece of art in the hopes of passing it off as your own.\nThe skill can also determine the approximate value of\na piece of art either on the open market, for monetary\nexchange systems, or in terms of reputation for the\nartist.\n<br/> <strong>Sample Fields:</strong> Architecture, Criticism, Dance, Drama,\nDrawing, Painting, Performance, Sculpture, Simulspace Design, Singing, Speech, Writing\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> As appropriate to the field\nsubsubsectionBEAM WEAPONS\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Combat\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> COO\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> The Beam Weapons skill covers the usage\nand maintenance of standard coherent beam energy\nweapons such as lasers, particle beam weapons,\nplasma rifles, and microwave weapons (p. 338).\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> A player uses their Beam Weapons skill whenever attacking with a beam weapon in\ncombat (p. 191). Beam Weapons may also be used for\ntests involving maintenance of the weapon, but not\nfor repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be\nHardware: Armorer skill).\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Lasers, Microwave Weapons, Particle\nBeam Weapons, Plasma Rifles\nsubsubsectionBLADES\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Combat\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> SOM\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> The Blades skill covers the usage and\nmaintenance of standard bladed weapons (p. 334).\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> A player uses their Blades skill\nwhenever attacking with a blade weapon in melee\ncombat (p. 191). Blades may also be used for tests\ninvolving maintenance of the weapon, but not for\nrepairing or modifying the weapon (that would be\nHardware: Armorer skill). This skill is used for blade\nweapons implanted in the body at the end of an appendage (hands, forearms, feet, octomorph arms, etc.),\nbut the Exotic Melee Weapon skill is used for blades\nimplanted in other parts of the body.\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Axes, Implant Blades, Knives, Swords\nsubsubsectionCLIMBING\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Physical\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> SOM\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> Climbing is the skill of ascending and\ndescending sheer surfaces with or without the aid of\nspecialized equipment.\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> This skill is used whenever a character wishes to scale a climbable surface. For heights\ngreater than one story, climbing is handled as a Task\nAction with a timeframe equivalent to one meter per\nAction Phase. For rappelling, the timeframe for descent is 50 meters per Action Turn. Climbing gear (p.\n332-333) provides appropriate modifiers.\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Assisted, Freehand, Rappelling\n%%% txt/180.txt\nsubsubsectionCLUBS\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Combat\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> SOM\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> The Clubs skill covers the usage and\nmaintenance of standard blunt melee weapons such\nas batons or sticks (see p. 334).\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> Players use their Clubs skill whenever they want to attack with a blunt weapon in melee\ncombat (p. 191). The Clubs skill may also be used for\ntests involving maintenance of the weapon, but not\nfor repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be\nHardware: Armorer skill).\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Batons, Hammers, Staffs\nsubsubsectionCONTROL\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Mental, Psi\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> WIL\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> Control is the use of psi to manipulate\nindividuals or actively penetrate their mental processes. This skill is only available to characters with\nthe Psi trait (p. 147).\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> Use Control when taking a psionic\ntour through a foreign ego—messing around included.\nSee Psi, p. 220.\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> By sleight\nsubsubsectionDECEPTION\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Social\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> SAV\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> Deception is your ability to act, bluff,\ncon, fast talk, lie, misrepresent, and pretend. Accomplished users of deception are able to convince anyone\nof nearly anything. This skill does not include using a\nphysical disguise to appear to be another person (the\nImpersonate skill covers that area).\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> Use this skill whenever you want\nto deceive someone with words or gestures. A successful skill test means that you have passed off your deception convincingly. At the gamemaster’s discretion,\nsomeone who is actively alert for signs of deception\nmay make an Opposed Test using the Kinesics skill.\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Acting, Bluffing, Fast Talk\nsubsubsectionDEMOLITIONS\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Technical\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> COG (no defaulting)\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> Demolitions covers the use of controlled\nexplosives.\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> Use it when making, placing, and\ndisarming explosives and explosive devices.

Diving off a cliff into a lake, preventing yourself from being swept away in a raging river\ncurrent, or making sure you’ve set a proper gas mix\nfor a deep-sea dive, among other things, requires a\nSuccess Test.\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Diving, Freestyle, Underwater Diving\nsubsubsectionTHROWING WEAPONS\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Combat\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> COO\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> Throwing Weapons skill covers the use\nand maintenance of standard throwing weapons, like\ngrenades (p. 340).\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> Use Throwing Weapons skill\nwhenever you are attacking with a throwing weapon\nin ranged combat (p. 191).\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Grenades, Knives, Rocks\n%%% txt/187.txt\nsubsubsectionUNARMED COMBAT\n<strong>Type:</strong> Active, Combat\n<br/> <strong>Linked Aptitude:</strong> SOM\n<br/> <strong>What it is:</strong> Unarmed Combat is your ability to attack and\ndefend without using weapons.\n<br/> <strong>When you use it:</strong> Use Unarmed Combat whenever you\nwant to attack someone with your fists, feet, elbows, knees,\nor other body parts in melee combat (p. 191).\n<br/> <strong>Specializations:</strong> Implant Weaponry, Kick, Punch, Subdual\nbeginquotation\n<strong>USING KNOWLEDGE SKILLS</strong>\n<br/>\nAt first glance, it may seem that Knowledge skills have\nfewer in-game applications than Active skills. To some\ndegree this is the case. The importance of Knowledge\nskills, however, should not be underestimated. While\nthey play a role in analyzing clues and solving mysteries, the real value of Knowledge skills is in helping the\ncharacters—and the players—understand the world of\nEclipse Phase. In particular these skills can be used to\nmake plans, assess a situation, identify strengths and\nweaknesses, evaluate worth, make comparisons, forecast\nprobable outcomes, or understand the applicable science,\nsocio-economic factors, or cultural or historical context.\nFor example, a group of characters looking to break\ninto a facility could use Profession: Security Procedures\nto evaluate the defenses, Academic: Architecture to\nidentify covert points of entry, Interests: Sports to plan\ntheir infiltration at a time when the guards are likely to\nbe distracted, Interests: Triads to identify a local crime\ngroup that can sell them breaking and entering gear,\nand Art: Sculpture when picking a valuable art piece\nwith which to bribe an insider. When used appropriately,\nthese skills can be just as beneficial as the Active skills\nused to break inside, if not more so because the plan\nis more likely to succeed as a result of this preparation.\nIt is largely up to the gamemaster to enforce how\nuseful Knowledge skills are in their game. The easiest\nway to reinforce their relevance is to penalize characters who don’t take advantage of them. For example,\ncharacters who didn’t use their Profession: Security\nProcedures in the example above might end up being\nsurprised when they run across a security system they\nare not prepared to deal with, forcing them to improvise or even abandon their plans.\nendquotation"
