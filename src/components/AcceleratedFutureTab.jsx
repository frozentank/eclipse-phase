For this reason, almost\neveryone in the solar system is equipped with a cortical\nstack (p. 300).

        "html": "Cortical stack implants deploy a network of nanobots\nthroughout the brain that take a snapshot of\nthe mind's neural state, storing the data as a backup\nwithin the cortical stack. The average transhuman's\ncortical stack backs up their ego 86,400 times per day.\nOnly the most recent backup is kept within the stack;\nolder ones are overwritten. Pods and synthmorphs\nalso can be equipped with cortical stacks (though\nAI-piloted bots often lack this feature), though these\nversions maintain an updated copy of the ego running\nin the morph's cyberbrain.\nIn the case of death, accidental or otherwise, a cortical\nstack can be retrieved from a corpse and used to\nrecover the character, either as an infomorph or by\nresleeving them in a new morph. Cortical stacks are\ndiamond-hardened and protected, so they may often\nbe retrieved even if the corpse is badly mangled or\ndamaged. If the corpse cannot be recovered or the\ncortical stack is destroyed, the backup is lost.\nHigh rollers, well-equipped brinkers, and others\nin dangerous professions often opt for an emergency\nfarcaster accessory (p. 306) that periodically (usually\nevery 48 hours, but varying according to contract)\ntransmits a backup from the cortical stack to a remote\nstorage facility. This option is quite expensive, however\nand so is generally only afforded by the wealthy.\nsubsubsectionRetrieving A Cortical Stack\nMost cortical stacks are carefully excised from a\ncorpse with surgery. In certain circumstances, however,\na character may need to extract a cortical stack in the\nfield, whether because transporting the corpse is impractical\nor because the dead person is an enemy and\nthey either don't want them knowing who killed them\nor they want to interrogate them with psychosurgery\nin a simulspace.\nThe process of cutting out a cortical stack is called\n\"popping,\" as a skilled extractor can usually get the\nsmooth-shelled implant to pop right out by making\nan incision in the correct place and applying pressure.\nOne does need to be careful that the tiny, blood-slick\nstack doesn't slip away once popped.\nPopping can be done with a sharp knife and elbow\ngrease, though it is grisly. Popping a stack is a Task\nAction that requires a Medicine: [any appropriate\nfield] Test with a timeframe of 1 minute and a modifier\nof +20. Morphs with stacks in non-standard locations\nor with anatomical shielding (carapace plates,\netc.) around the stack may incur penalties to this test\nat the gamemaster's discretion. Of course, if you don't\nhave the time for a precise extraction, you can always\njust cut the entire head off and take it with you.\nOnce a cortical stack is retrieved, it may be loaded\ninto an ego bridge (p. 328) and used to bring the ego\nback, either as an infomorph or by resleeving.\n<strong>Living Subjects:</strong> Cortical stacks may be excised\nfrom living people, but the process is usually fatal (or\nat least paralyzing) as it involves cutting through the\nspinal column. If the target is not unconscious or otherwise\nincapacitated, they must first be immobilized\nin melee combat (see <em>Subdual,</em> p. 204). Cutting out\nthe stack is handled like a Medicine Task Action as\nabove, but this process inflicts 3d10 + 10 damage on\nthe target. If the test fails, they still inflict 1d10 + 10\ndamage to the target. If the person removing the stack\nwants to leave the target alive or harm them as little\nas possible, they suffer a –20 modifier on the test, but\nmay reduce the damage by 1d10 per 10 full points of\nMoS. Living through the process of having your stack\nremoved is traumatic; anyone who does so suffers\n1d10 mental stress.\nsubsubsectionDestroying A Cortical Stack\nCortical stacks have an Armor of 20 and a Durability\nof 20 for anyone attempting to destroy them."

        "title": "Uploading",
        "html": "Uploading a backup into secure storage is usually\nhandled with a brain scan at the storage facility's clinic\nusing a bread box-sized unit called an <em>ego bridge</em> (p.\n328). When activated, the ego bridge's sensor array\ntwists open like a morning glory blossom, revealing an\nenclosure with a neck rest that automatically adjusts\nitself to morphs with oddly-sized or -shaped heads.\nThe neck rest deploys millions of specialized nanobots\n%%% 271\ninto the brain and central nervous system. The petals\nare full of sensors that image the brain using a combination\nof MRI, sonogram, and positional information\nbroadcast by the nanobot swarm in the morph's brain.\nThe ego bridge then builds a digital copy of the person's\nbrain, which is stored away in the service's highly\nsecure, off-the-mesh, hardwired data vaults.\nIn the case of pods, the ego bridge scans the biological\nbrain bits and also accesses the cyberbrain to copy\nthe parts of the ego residing there. For synthmorphs,\nwho have no biological brain, the process is much\nsimpler, as it simply requires accessing and making a\ncopy of their cyberbrain.\nIn a standard clinic with an undamaged morph, uploading\ntakes only 10 minutes, 5 with a pod. In other\nsituations, however, the process may take longer if the\ngamemaster so decides. Uploading from a synthmorph\nor extracted cortical stack is instantaneous. The ego\nbridge largely operates itself. While oversight by a\nmedical specialist is a good idea, no test is necessary.\nIf an uploading character does not plan to return\nto their morph, it is usually put on ice until someone\nelse resleeves into it. If a new resleeve is not ready\nand the uploading character doesn't want to leave a\npotential copy of themselves behind, they can have\nthe morph's mind wiped by the nanobots as part of\nthe uploading process.\nsubsubsectionUploading-Resleeving Continuity\nIn ideal circumstances, a person who is intentionally\nresleeving (p. 271) can arrange for the uploading and\nresleeving process to occur without any noticeable\nloss of continuity. Though the experience of switching\nfrom one morph to another is still a bit jarring, the\ntransition itself can be made into a seamless process,\nwith no gaps in awareness or memory, which helps\nreduce associated mental stress.\nIn this case, during the process of uploading, the\nego bridge is also connected to another ego bridge\nand the new sleeve. This connection can even be made\nwirelessly or by farcaster link (with a maximum distance\nof 10,000 kilometers).\nAs the mind is uploaded, the ego bridge builds a\nvirtual brain by copying the morph's brain bit by bit,\nusing the data gained from the brain scan. At the same\ntime, this data is slowly copied to the new sleeve as\nnanobots rewire the sleeve's brain structure (a much\nslower process). As the transfer occurs, the nanobots\nin the brain sever individual neural connections and\nre-route them to their duplicates in the virtual brain,\nand then eventually to the new brain. Effectively, the\ncharacter's ego is running partially on the meat brain\nand partially on the virtual copy. By the time the nanobots\nsever the last of the neural connections in the\nold brain, the ego is running completely on the virtual\nbrain and the new sleeve's brain. Once the resleeving\nis completed, the virtual brain is shut down.\nIn terms of perceptions, the character, who is awake\nduring this process, experiences a very gradual shift\nfrom one morph to the other. As the process takes\nhours, however (or even longer if done via farcaster),\nthe subject usually entertains themselves with some\nAR media, VR, or even XP to pass the time.\nsubsubsectionUploading After Death\nIt is possible to upload the mind of a person who\nhas recently died as long as the nanobots have time\nto scan the brain before cell deterioration kicks in\ntoo heavily, which takes approximately 2 hours. It\nis possible to sustain a corpse for longer by placing\nit in a healing vat (p. 326) for nanostasis. Post-death\nuploads may suffer integrity damage; see <em>Backup </em>\n<em>Complications,</em> p. 270.\nCyberbrains may also be retrieved from a destroyed\nsynthmorph and reactivated, assuming they are not\ndamaged too heavily (gamemaster discretion).\nsubsubsectionDestructive Uploading\nThough rare, some people engage in a process called\ndestructive uploading, where the biological brain is literally\nsliced apart and scanned piece by piece. Considered\nabhorrent and wasteful by most transhumans, brain-peeling\nis practiced by some bioconservative factions\nwho view it as the only \"pure\" method of uploading\nor the only real way to transfer the \"soul.\" Such people\ntypically refuse to resleeve, living out the rest of their\nlives as infomorphs, quite often in dedicated simulspaces\nthat are treated as a sort of virtual afterlife."

        "title": "Backup Insurance",
        "html": "Almost everyone, with the exception of neo-primitivists\nand very young children, has a cortical stack. In the\nevent of death, however, a cortical stack alone will not\nensure resurrection unless you have acquired backup\ninsurance (p. 330) to cover the costs of your resleeving\nGoing without backup insurance for any length of\ntime is taking a severe risk. Some jurisdictions (such\nas the Titanian Commonwealth) have a practice of\nbringing everyone back, even if only to an infomorph\nstate, or at least filing the most recent backup away\nin dead storage just in case someone decides to pay\nto resurrect them later. Other authorities will simply\ndestroy the stack or, worse, sell it on the black market\nto a soul-trading syndicate such as Nine Lives.\nBackup insurance typically includes a subscription\nto an uploading facility, usually requiring a visit every\n6 months, to ensure that backup is held in safe storage\nin case of cortical stack loss. People with risky\njobs (construction bot supervisor, hypercorp exoplanet\nstaff, girl who fights vicious giant eels for rich\njaded audiences, etc.) may back up once a week, or\neven daily. In the event of a verified death where the\ncortical stack could not be retrieved, the most recent\nbackup is used to resleeve the person.\nAt the basic level, backup insurance will bring the\ncharacter back as an infomorph, at which point they\ncan access their credit and purchase a new morph.\nMore expensive versions will automatically resleeve\n%%% 272\nyou in the pre-purchased morph of your choice. The\nexceedingly rich will often have customized clones\n(often of their original body) waiting on ice for them.\nBackup insurance often involves a missing person\nclause, which states that a person will be brought\nback if they have not checked in for X amount of time\n(a calendar function automatically handled by your\nmuse) and cannot be located.\nIt is worth noting that some criminal syndicates\nalso offer backup insurance at a much reduced rate.\nThe likelihood that copies of your backup are being\nused for illicit purposes, however, is quite high. For\nsome people, however, what happens to a copy of\nthemselves is of no concern.\nsubsubsectionBackup Insurance Limitations\nBackup insurance is not always perfect. Though insurance\nproviders are required to make a reasonable\neffort to retrieve your cortical stack, for many hypercorps\nthis is a simple cost-benefit analysis that often\nwill not work in the character's favor. If you died in a\ndangerous area such as the Zone on Mars, in a remote\narea such as the Kuiper Belt, or are simply difficult\nto track down (pushed out an airlock somewhere),\nodds are against your cortical stack being retrieved—\ninstead you will be re-instanced from a backup.\nJurisdiction can also play an important role. The\ninsurance offered by many inner system providers is\nautomatically nullified if you travel to an anarchist\nhabitat, gatecrash, break the law, or engage in certain\nlife-threatening activities like suicide sports or scavenging\nin TITAN-infected ruins. At the least, they will\nrefuse to retrieve your stack in these circumstances.\nLikewise, if you struck a backup insurance deal with\na medical collective from an autonomist habitat and\nthen go and die on a hypercorp station, the hypercorp\nis very likely to refuse to recognize the authority of a\nbunch of anarchists and won't hand your stack over.\nEven an archived backup and a missing person\nclause is no guarantee. A determined enemy could\ncapture you, pry the backup insurance access codes\nfrom your muse, keep you on ice or quietly kill you,\nand then regularly \"check in\" on your behalf using\nthe access codes so that the insurance provider never\nrealizes you are dead or missing. Though this requires\nquite a bit of effort, it is often less difficult than dealing\nwith an immortal opponent who keeps coming\nback no matter how often you kill them.\nOther dangers also exist. An entire habitat may be\ndestroyed, taking you, your backups, and your insurance\nprovider's records with it. A resourceful enemy\nmight penetrate a provider's security and delete your\nbackups, or simply bribe the right people to make\nsure they get \"accidentally\" corrupted. Given these\npossibilities, the paranoid often make sure to get\nmultiple redundant backup policies, assuming they\ncan afford it."

In any of these\ninstances, make a LUC Test for the character. If the\ntest fails, they suffer 1 point of mental stress per 10\nfull points of MoF.

The new sleeve is hooked up to an ego bridge\nwhich infiltrates the brain with nanobots that physically\nrestructure the brain's neural structure and connections\naccording to the map provided by the backup.\nSleeving takes six times as long as uploading because\nthe nanobot swarm working as a wet printer in the\ntemplate brain needs to duplicate the entire physical\nstructure of the ego's neural network. For resleeving, a\n\"wet\" ego bridge is used, meaning that the sleeve and\nego bridge are submerged in a vat filled with nanogel.\nThe resleeving process for pods takes only half an hour,\nas pods brains are half biological and half cyberbrain.\nbeginquotation\n<strong>Resleeving And The Gamesmaster</strong> %RESLEEVING AND THE GAMEMASTER}\n<br/>\nThe gamemaster has a fine amount of control over what a character can obtain when resleeving. The\ncharacters may be supplied with new morphs by Firewall or whatever employer/patron for whom they are\ncurrently working. In this case, the gamemaster can simply assign whatever morphs they see fit — with complete\ncontrol over enhancements, traits, etc. While morphs should be tailored for the mission at hand, this\npresents an opportunity for the gamemaster to throw the characters some new toys to play with and also\nsome new challenges to overcome. Gamemasters are encouraged to mix it up, have fun, and give players\nsomething they can work with without necessarily giving them everything they want.<br/>\nIn other cases, the availability of desired morphs may be limited by the resleeving location. A small\noutpost in the wilds of Mars is unlikely to have a wide selection of morphs — in fact, a few rusters and\nsynthmorphs may be all they have. Similarly, large habitats have a high demand for good morphs, so there\nmay be a waiting list for top-of-the-line sylphs or remade morphs, for example. In the same vein, available\nmorphs are going to be subject to local legalities, so getting that reaper morph may be out of the question.\nCharacters could always turn to black market morph providers, but these come with their own risks.<br/>\nWhat this means is that gamemasters should never be afraid to say no if a character is pursuing a morph\nthat is unreasonable or potentially disruptive to the game. While it’s good form to give the players what they\nwant once in a while, it also makes for more interesting roleplaying to saddle them with morphs that are\na little different than what they were hoping for or that come with some interesting challenges, such as a\nphysical addiction. For extra fun, leave the character unaware of a morph’s negative traits or secret implants\nuntil they reveal themselves.

Like a topiary shrub, the portions\nof the character's neural network that exceed the capacities\nof the intended fork are trimmed away. In addition\nto the changes noted under <em>Beta Forks</em> (p. 273),\ncharacters may voluntarily choose to delete/decrease\nskills and remove memories.\nDelta forks are created by excising the ego's surface\npersonality traits and applying them to an AI template.\nIn this case the ego's memories are usually excluded\nentirely—it is easier to start with a blank delta fork\nand feed them the specific memories/knowledge they\nneed. As with beta forks, characters making delta forks\nmay voluntarily choose to delete/decrease skills and\nkeep specific memories. If an alpha fork is not available\nto prune, a delta fork can be whipped up from\na biomorph brain with an ego bridge and 1 minute.\nMany people sleeved in biomorphs keep delta forks on\nhand in storage, to whip up on the fly as needed.\nTranshumanity's grasp of neuroscience extends to\nscanning and copying a mind, but the most intricate\nworkings of memory are still imperfectly understood.\nMaking precise edits to individual portions of a neural\nnetwork (to alter recollections, skills, and the like) is\nstill a black art. The difficulty with neural pruning is\nthat taking a weed whacker to the tree of memory\nisn't an exact science. Specific memories may not be\nexcised or chosen—at best, memories may be handled\nin broad clumps, typically grouped by time periods no\nfiner than 6 months. For simplicity, most beta forks are\ncreated by removing all memories older than 1 year.\nWhen creating a beta or delta fork, the character\nmust make a Psychosurgery Test (other parties may\nmake this test on the character's behalf, representing\nthat the character is giving them access to prune the\nfork appropriately). If the character succeeds, the fork\nis created as desired. If the test fails, the gamemaster\nchooses one of the following penalties for every 10\nfull points of MoF. Some of these penalties may be\ncombined for a cumulative effect:\nbeginitemize\n• 1 additional skill decreased by –20\n• Fork acquires a Negative mental trait worth 10 CP\n• Fork suffers 1d10 <em>div</em> 2 (round up) mental stress\n• Extra memory loss (gamemaster discretion; beta forks only)\n• 1 Positive trait lost\nenditemize\nsubsubsectionNeural Pruning With Long-Term Psychosurgery\nRather than generating forks on the fly, some characters\nprefer to have carefully-pruned forks on hand,\nstored as inert files that can be called up, copied, and\nrun as needed. These forks are crafted with long-term\npsychosurgery, meaning that they suffer fewer drawbacks\nand the memories may be more finely tuned.\nLong-term neural pruning requires a Psychosurgery\nTest as above, but with a +30 modifier. Delta forks take\n1 week to prune this way, beta forks take 1 month. Additional\nmodifications may be made to the fork using\nany of the normal rules for psychosurgery (p. 229).\nIt is worth noting that some people prefer to use\nforks of themselves or loved ones rather than a muse.\nLikewise, some wealthy hyperelites are known to keep\ncopies of their younger backups on hand, sometimes\nfor decades, and re-instance these when their prime\nego has enough skill and experience to completely\noutclass its younger selves. Though technically these\nare alpha forks, their lag behind the original ego is\ncomparable in degree to that of a beta fork. This is\nrumored to be the method used by the Pax Familiae\nin instancing her army of cloned selves."

The exact dividing\nline between an ego and a fork is a central philosophical\nand legal debate among many transhumans.\n%%% 277\nThis means that gamemaster should not be afraid\nto pull a fork out of a player character's hands and\nmake them into an NPC if they start too diverge too\ngreatly. Similarly, if a fork begins to learn information\nthat the main character does not (yet) have access to,\nit is probably also better to run the fork as an NPC in\norder to avoid metagaming.\nIt is entirely possible that a fork might decide that\nit will no longer obey the originating ego and carry\nabout doing its own thing.

Characters may purchase\nhazard insurance that will cover taking the morph\ninto certain dangerous situations, but this will\ndouble the rental price at minimum.\n%%% 281\nIf a character suffers extensive organic damage or\ndeath while insured, the insurance will cover 80%\nof the morph's cost, meaning that the character is\nexpected to pay the other 20%. If they cannot pay,\ntheir possessions or their stored morph may be\nseized in payment.\nIf a character violates their insurance policy by\nintentionally putting themself in harm's way above\nthe threat level at which the policy was purchased,\nwithout first communicating with and rendering payment\nto the insurer, the policy may be declared void.\nIf the leased morph dies under a voided policy and\nthe character cannot pay to replace it, their possessions\nand stored morph may be subject to seizure.\nSeizure takes different forms depending upon the\nlocal economy and legal system. In hypercorp space,\nit is a straightforward seizure of liquid assets, including\nforced uploading if the character's morph is\nseized. Elsewhere, the character is more likely to end\nup owing a lot of favors or taking severe hits to their\nreputation, but they are unlikely to undergo forced\nuploading or outright physical seizure of their morph."

What you look like may\ndrastically change from one day to the next. You\nmay see an olympian you recognize, but perhaps it's\nbeen awhile, so you're no longer certain that it's the\nsame person still in that morph. If you're sleeved in a\npopular off-the-rack morph, there may be hundreds\nof other cloned morphs that look exactly like you out\nthere—perhaps useful if you desire to blend in. Similarly\nsecurity services can no longer rely on biometric\ntechnologies. Forensics may be able to identify an individual\nmorph's presence at a crime scene, but proving\nwho was in that morph at the time is another matter.\nIdentity is, of course, tied to ego, and various\nauthorities have instituted verification and security\nmeasures based on this. Within the inner system, each\nego is given an ID number, which is used to validate\ntheir identity, citizenship, legal status, credit accounts,\nlicensing, etc. This ego ID is verifiable by the person's\nbrainwave patterns, which remain the same even\nwhen resleeving. When an ego uploads, the uploading\nservice is required to incorporate this ego ID into\nthe person's backup/infomorph. Likewise, when that\nperson resleeves, the service handling the procedure\nis required by law to verify the ego's ID before downloading\nThe ego ID is then hardcoded into the morph\nitself in the form of a nanotattoo on the tip of the person's\nindex finger. This nanotat can be easily scanned\nat security checkpoints to verify identity.\nThough efficient, this system is far from perfect. For\none, ID record-keeping is far from standardized and\nvaries drastically from habitat to habitat. Most do not\nshare records with each other unless they are part of the\nsame political alliance in order to protect their citizens'\nprivacy. For example, Lunar-Lagrange Alliance stations\ndo not share citizenship ID data with the Planetary\nConsortium, though they do share with each other.\nOn top of this, many identity records were lost\nduring the Fall, a situation that was undoubtedly exploited\nby those who preferred to erase their past or\nadopt a new persona. These all make for a situation\nwhere identity records are patchwork at best. Officials\nmust also rely on the security of other habitats for ID\nverification. If a person egocasts to Nectar on Mars\nfrom Qing Long in the Martian Trojans, and the\nNectar officials have no record of this person, they\ncan only trust that the Qing Long officials did their\njob when verifying the subject's ID and background.\nTo make matters worse, many autonomist habitats\noperate without identity checks altogether. Though\nsome ID measures are still used, both to prevent\nreputation system gaming and to be able to identify\nbodies in the case of death, these uses are significantly\nmore lax and few records are kept. Therefore, when\nautonomists and the like egocast to habitats that require\nID, they are assigned a temporary ID for the duration\nof their stay (and sometimes any future visits)."

        "html": "There are three ways to verify someone's identity:\nnanotat scan, brainwave scan, and checking the cryptographic\nhash on a digital mind.\nsubsubsectionNanotat Scans\nSpecial encoded nanobots are used to create a small\nnanotat on a person's index finger. These  nanobots\ncontain encoded information that includes their name\nand identity, brainwave pattern, citizenship/legal status,\ncredit account number, insurance information, and\nlicenses. Depending on the local habitat laws, it may\ninclude other information such as criminal history,\ntravel history, restricted implants, employment records,\nand so on. This nanotat may be read by anyone with\na special ID scanner that reads the nanobot encoding.\nID nanotats include information on the company\nthat did the resleeving, so that the data may be accessed\nand verified with their records online. The data\non the nanotat is also cryptographically signed with\nthe company's public key, meaning that anyone who\nchecks the data and the signature online can tell if the\ndata has been altered.\nsubsubsectionBrainwave Scans\nBrainwave scans are one of the few types of biometric\nprints that stay with an ego no matter what morph it\nis in. They are impractical for most security purposes\nas they require a scan with a combination electroencephalogram\nand neuroimaging device, referred to as\na brainprint scanner, which takes approximately 5\nminutes. This device measures the subject's baseline\nbrainwave pattern as well as the subject's brainwave\nsignature responses when they think certain thoughts\n%%% 282\nor sense certain patterns. These scans are all but\nimpossible to fool, however, barring hacking of the\nbrainprint scanner itself, and so are considered quite\nreliable. For this reason they are occasionally used in\nhigh-security facilities.\nIt is worth noting that infection by some variants\nof the Exsurgent virus, notably the Watts-Macleod\nstrain (p. 367), sometimes alters a person's brainwave\npatterns, but not in every case.\nsubsubsectionDigital Code\nDigital ID codes are often incorporated into backups and\ninfomorphs. Not only does this help identify who the\nbackup belongs to, but it serves as an electronic signature\nfor verifying ID when the backup is to be resleeved. This\ndigital code typically contains the same information as\nthe nanotat ID, and is signed with a cryptographic hash\nthat makes it difficult to forge and which can be verified\nonline. AIs and AGIs also feature such built-in codes."

        "html": "Firewall sentinels and clandestine agents often have a\nneed to hide or alter their identities. While ID system\nare challenging, they are not insurmountable.\nsubsubsectionFake IDs\nThe easiest way to bypass security checks is to establish\na fake ID. Given the patchwork nature of identity records\nand the lack of any centralized authority, this is\nnot very difficult. Numerous crime syndicates and even\nsome autonomist groups maintain a thriving ID fabrication\nbusiness, often with complete histories and medical\ncovers for implants that might be restricted or illegal.\nThese IDs are usually registered with habitats that are\neither known criminal havens, have autonomist sympathies\nor are isolated and remote. Though the ID is\nactually verifiable and registered with these stations, the\npotential shady origins of such IDs is known to most\ninner system authorities and so the character may be\nexposed to extra scrutiny or monitoring. Fake IDs may\nbe acquired that are registered with more respected authorities\nbut this often requires a much higher expense\nor connections to hypercorp clandestine operations.\nBlack market darkcast and resleeving options offer\nfake IDs as a matter of course.\nsubsubsectionAltering Nanotat IDs\nSpecial nanobot treatments may be manufactured\nto erase, rewrite, or replace nanotat IDs. Erasing a\nnanotat is easy, but not having one is a crime and immediate\ngrounds for suspicion in many habitats. Rewriting\na nanotat is also easy, though this means that\nthe nanotat will fail its authorization online unless the\nencryption has also been cracked (p. 253). Replacing\na nanotat ID with a fake one is just as possible, and is\npart of the process of acquiring a fake ID.\nsubsubsectionDigital ID Tampering\nDigital ID codes may also be tampered with, though like\nnanotat IDs this will mean that the ID fails online verification\nunless the encryption is also defeated (p. 253)."

        "title": "Space Habitats",
        "html": "Space habitats come in many sizes and configurations\nfrom survivalist outposts designed to support\nten or fewer people to miniature worlds in resource-rich\nareas housing as many as ten million people. In\nheavily settled regions of space, such as Martian orbit,\nhabitats may be integrated into local infrastructure,\nrelying to some extent on supply shipments from other\norbital installations.\nMore commonly, especially in the outer system,\nhabitats are independent entities. This usually means\nthat in addition to the main space station, the habitat\nis attended by a host of support structures, including\nzero-g factories, gas and volatiles refineries, foundries,\ndefense satellites, and mining bases.\nHabitats—especially large ones—sometimes have\nvisitors, as well. Majors habitats are crossroads in\nspace. In addition to scheduled bulk freighter stops,\nthey may have hangers-on such as scum barges, prospectors\nor out-of-work autonomous bot swarms.\nMany habitats have some form of transportation\nnetwork. This is most common in large cylindrical\nhabitats with centrifugal gravity. Common solutions\nfor public transit include monorail trains, trams, and\ndirigible skybuses. Common personal transit options\nincluded bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, and microlight\naircraft, with larger vehicles being uncommon\nand usually reserved for official use.\nMost habitats with large interior spaces also use augmented\nreality overlays to create consensual hallucinations\nof a sky and clouds, to which most residents keep\ntheir AR channels tuned. One would think that in space,\ntalking about the weather would have disappeared from\ntranshumanity's repertoire of small talk, but the habit\npersists—only the weather discussed is usually virtual (if\nit's not real \"weather\"—solar flare activity and the like).\nsubsubsectionCluster Colony\nClusters are the most common form of microgravity\nhabitat. Clusters consist of networks of spherical or\nrectangular modules made of light materials and connected\nby floatways. Typically business and residential\nmodules are clustered around arterial floatways and infrastructure\nmodules such as farms, power, and waste\nrecycling. Limited artificial gravity areas may exists,\nfrequently parks or other public places and specialized\nmodules like resleeving facilities (morphs often keep\nbetter when stored in gravity). Arterial floatways in\nlarge clusters may have \"fast lanes\" where a constantly\nmoving conveyor of grab-loops speeds people along.\n%%% 283\nClusters are most commonly found in volatile-rich environments\nlike the Trojans and the ring systems of the gas giants (particularly\nSaturn). Clusters are rare in the Jovian system because shielding a\ncluster of individual modules rather than one large station from\nJupiter's intense magnetosphere is hideously inefficient.\nCluster colonies can have anywhere from 50 to 250,000 inhabitants.\nsubsubsectionCole Bubbles\nCole bubbles (or \"bubbleworlds\") are found mostly in the main\nasteroid belt, where the large nickel-iron asteroids used to construct\nthem are abundant. Bubbleworlds are less common in the Trojans\nand Greeks, where crusty ice asteroids predominate. A Cole bubble\nis similar in many respects to an O'Neill cylinder, but there are no\nlongitudinal windows. Sunlight instead enters through axial mirror\narrays. The bubbleworld is also constructed very differently, using a\nlarge solar array to heat a pocket of water inside of a metal asteroid\nso that the metal expands. Rotating the asteroid causes the malleable\nmaterial to form a cylinder, which is then capped off and the\nwater drained. The inside can then be pressurized, built out, and\nplanted. Cole bubbles can also be spun for gravity, according to the\nwhims of the inhabitants, though the gravity lowers as you near the\npoles of the bubble, with zero gravity at the axis of rotation.\nCole bubbles are among the largest structures transhumanity has\ncreated in space. The largest Cole habitat, Extropia, has a population\nof 10 million.\nsubsubsectionHamilton Cylinders\nHamilton cylinders are a new technology. There are only three fully\noperational Hamilton cylinders in the system, but the design shows\ngreat promise and is likely to be widely adopted over the coming\nperiod. Hamilton cylinders are grown using a complex genomic\nalgorithm that orchestrates nanoscale building machines. These\nnanobots build the habitat slowly over time, a process more like\ngrowing than construction.\nSimilar to O'Neill cylinders and Cole bubbles, a Hamilton cylinder\nis a cylindrical habitat rotating on its long axis to provide gravity\nTwo of the known Hamilton cylinders orbit Saturn in positions\nskimming the rings near the Cassini division. From this position,\nthey can graze on silicates and volatiles using harvester ships.\nNone of the currently-operating Hamilton cylinders have grown\nto full size yet, but estimates say they could each house up to 3\nmillion people.\nsubsubsectionO'Neill Cylinders\nFound mostly in the orbits of Earth, Luna, Venus, and Mars, O'Neill\ncylinders were among transhumanity's first large space habitat designs\nO'Neill cylinders are no longer built, having been replaced\nby more efficient designs, but are still home to tens of millions of\ntranshumans. O'Neill cylinders were constructed from metals mined\non Luna or Mercury, Lunar volatiles (including Lunar polar ice),\nand asteroidal silicates.\nA typical O'Neill habitat is thirty-five kilometers long, eight kilometers\nin diameter, and rotates around its long axis at a speed\nsufficient for centrifugal force to create one Earth gravity on the\ninner wall of the cylinder. Smaller cylinders exist, though these\nusually feature lower gravity (typically Mars standard). Cylinders\nare sometimes joined together, end-to-end, for extra long habitats.\nA spaceport is situated at one end on the rotational axis of the\ncylinder (where there is no gravity). Arrivals by space use a lift or\nmicrolight launch pad to get down to the habitat floor.\n%%% 284\nThe inside of an O'Neill cylinder has six alternating\nstrips of ground and window running from one cap\nof the cylinder to the other. One narrow end of an\nO'Neill cylinder points toward the sun. The opposite\nend is the mooring point for three immense reflectors\nangled to reflect sunlight into the windows. Smart\nmaterials coating the windows and reflectors prevent\nfluctuations in solar activity from delivering too much\nheat. The air inside the cylinder and its metal superstructure\nprovide radiation shielding.\nThe land in most O'Neill cylinders is one-third\nagricultural (a combination of food vats and high-yield\nphotosynthetic crops), one-third park land, and\none-third mixed use residential and business. O'Neill\nhabitats have a day and night cycle regulated by the\nposition of the external mirrors. The business and\nresidential sections of the cylinder usually alternate\nwith the park land over two of the strips of land;\ncropland usually takes up the third. Bridges cross\nthe windows every kilometer or so, linking the land\nstrips. The interior climate, the architectural style of\nthe structures, and the types of vegetation and fauna\npresent vary with the tastes of the habitats' designers.\nDepending upon size, O'Neill cylinders can house\nfrom 25,000 to 2 million people.\nsubsubsectionTin Cans\nAntique research stations and survivalist prospector\noutposts often fit this description. Tin can habitats\nare only a few notches up from the early 21st-century\nInternational Space Station. Tin cans usually consist\nof one or more modules connected to solar panels\nand other utilities by an open truss. Deluxe models\nfeature actual floatways or crawlways between\nmodules, while barebones setups require a vacsuit or\nvac-resistant morph to go from room to room. Food\ngrowing capacity is severely limited and there may be\nno farcasters, but fabricators are available, as well as\nmooring for shuttles and perhaps prospecting craft.\nTin cans rarely house more than 50 people.\nsubsubsectionToruses\nInterchangeably called toruses, toroids, donuts, and\nwheels, these circular space habitats were a cheap\nalternative to the O'Neill cylinder used for smaller\ninstallations. Like O'Neill cylinders, toruses are seldom\nconstructed anymore, but many are still encountered in\nthe inner system, particularly in Earth and Lunar orbit.\nA toroidal habitat looks like a donut 1 kilometer in\ndiameter, rotating on great spokes. There is a zero-g\nspaceport at the wheel's hub. Visitors take a lift down\none of the spokes to the level of the donut, where\nrotation creates one Earth gravity.\nThe plan of toroidal habitats varies greatly, as many\nwere designed for specific scientific or military purposes\nand only later taken over as habitats by entrepreneurs\nor squatters. Many have a succession of decks in the\ndonut. Most of those designed for long-term self-sufficient\nhabitation have smart material-covered glass\nwindows for growing plants along much of the inside\nsurface of the torus. Toroidal habitats equipped for\nfarming normally face the sun in a direction perpendicular\nto their rotational axis, but then use a slow processional\nwobble of that axis to create a day/night cycle.\nToruses were usually built to accommodate small\ncrews of 500 or fewer people, though some larger\nones exist, able to house 50,000. A few rare double-toruses\nalso exist, like two large wheels spinning in\nopposite directions, joined at the axis."

        "title": "Immigration And Customs",
        "html": "How characters gain entry to a habitat and what type\nof screening they're likely to undergo depends upon\nhow they arrive. Some habitats are close to other\nsettlements, while others are physically isolated by the\nvast, empty distances of interplanetary space.\nHabitats in dense planetary systems receive most of\ntheir visitors via conventional space travel. Immigration\nand customs infrastructure is geared toward receiving\nvisitors via their spaceport, and the processing\nof arrivals is in most ways analogous to a twentieth\ncentury airport. Isolated habitats, on the other hand,\ntend to receive almost all of their visitors via egocast.\nsubsubsectionPhysical Arrivals\nArrivals by spacecraft undergo, at minimum, an ego\nID check, scans to detect pathogens, hostile nanobots,\nexplosives, or radiation, and an inspection of their\npersonal effects. Some habitats go farther, including\nrigorous secondary screenings using scout nanoswarms\nscans of all electronic systems for malware,\nand/or aggressive interrogation of a fork of the subject.\nEven autonomist enclaves enforce automated scans for\nanything that might pose a danger to the habitat or\nany signs of hypercorp saboteur efforts.\nRestricted goods vary according to local legalities.\nMany habitats, particularly those controlled by autonomist\nor criminal factions, allow personal weaponry\nas long as its nothing you can use to blow a hole in\nthe structure or indiscriminately kill dozens of people.\nOthers, notably the Jovian Republic and hypercorp\nstations, disallow lethal weapons of all kinds, except\nfor people who have acquired special permits and authorization\n(sometimes available by bribing the right\npeople or pulling favors with rep). Nonlethal weapons\nare generally allowed. Other restricted items may\ninclude nanofabricators, nanoswarms, malware and\nhacker software, drugs and narcoalgorithms, certain\ntypes of XP recordings, covert operations tools, and\nso on. Certain types of morphs may also be restricted,\nsuch as reapers, furies, or uplifts.\nCertain habitats may insist that visitors—or at\nleast the ones they don't like the looks of—submit to\nspecific forms of monitoring or surveillance for the\nduration of their stay. This might include taggant\nnanoswarms, hosting a police AI in your mesh inserts,\nor even physical tailing by an armed security drone.\nOther stations will require that their visitors leave a\nfork as a form of collateral at the door—in case they\ncommit a crime, the fork can be interrogated.\n%%% 285\nFinally, though rare, some habitats go so far as to\ncharge all visitors an \"air tax\"—a fee for using the\nstation's publicly available resources while they are\npresent. This is generally only common in isolated\nhabitats with strained resources, and is considered\nespecially obnoxious by most autonomists.\nSome syndicates run a good business in smuggling\ncertain goods or even people into habitats. This is generally\naccomplished through bribed security personnel,\nbut is also sometimes handled as falsified credentials\nthat will allow the subject to breeze past security\nchecks. Such services are typically quite expensive.\nFor those hoping to gain quiet and unobserved\naccess, there is always the option of taking a spacewalk\nand trying to break in through an unattended\nairlock. Such attempts are quite often dangerous and\nfutile, as most habitats have dedicated sensor and\nsecurity systems to monitor their exterior surface and\nin particular any access points. Still, it is a possibility\nfor a resourceful team with a skilled hacker, though\narmed sentry bots are a particular danger.\nsubsubsectionElectronic Arrivals\nArrivals by egocast are sometimes interviewed by\nhabitat authorities in a simulspace before resleeving.\nDepending upon the habitat's attitude toward civil\nrights, this process can be relatively reasonable or\nquite invasive. A minimal entry inspection includes an\nID check, a brief interview with a customs AI, and a\nreview of the specs of the morph into which the arriving\nego plans to resleeve. Habitats with draconian\nimmigration measures may use harsh psychosurgery\ninterrogation techniques on suspect infomorphs. Egocast\nbackups have little recourse to avoid this treatment—station\nauthorities can simply file them away\nin cold storage if they choose—so it is wise to investigate\ncustom procedures before you send yourself over.\nBecause many people, particularly autonomists and\nbrinkers, don't appreciate this kind of reception, various\nuploading services have stepped in to provide pre-customs\nresleeving for characters traveling to habitats\nwith suspect screening methods. For often-exorbitant\nfees, the traveler egocasts into an extraterritorial substation\nclose to their intended destination, resleeves\nthere, and then travels to their destination by rocket.\nVarious darkcast services, normally run by established\ncrime syndicates, sometimes offer an alternative\nmethod of egocasting in and possibly even resleeving.\nDarkcast services are quite expensive, however, and\nthe character is at the mercy of the syndicate operators\nIn rare cases, some political factions or even hypercorps\nmight operate their own darkcast systems,\nwhich a character with good networking skills might\nbe able to take advantage of."

In\n<em>Eclipse Phase,</em> spacecraft are primarily dealt with as a\nsetting environment rather than a vehicle/gear to use.\nSpacecraft largely pilot themselves via the onboard AI.\nThough characters can also take over with their Pilot:\nSpacecraft skill, the situation rarely calls for it.\nsubsubsectionLocal Travel\nIn densely inhabited planetary systems such as Mars\nand Saturn, most travel between cities, surface stations,\nand orbital habitats within 200,000 kilometers is by\nsmall hydrogen-fueled (or sometimes methane-fueled)\nrockets. This form of travel is incredibly cheap, very\nfast, and avoids the occasional personality glitches\nthat crop up during egocasting. LOTVs (lander and\norbital transfer vehicles, p. 348) are commonly used.\nSpacecraft leaving a planetary body need to be able to\ngenerate enough thrust to escape the gravity well (see\n<em>Escaping Gravity Wells,</em> p. 346).\nsubsubsectionDistance Travel\nFor distances of 200,000 to 1.5 million kilometers,\nsomewhat larger (and more expensive) fusion- and\nplasma-drive craft make regular runs. Nuclear electric\nion drives were once used on some of these routes,\nbut the poor efficiency of these fission systems and the\nneed for radioactive heavy metal reaction mass means\nthat they are almost never used anymore. Faster antimatter-drive\ncouriers are also commonly used. These\nships lack the thrust to escape from the gravity wells\nof large planets or moons, so they station themselves\nin orbit and use smaller ships (typically LOTVs) with\nhigher thrust to transport people to and from the\nplanetary surface.\nFor distances beyond 1.5 million kilometers, almost\neveryone uses egocasting\nsubsubsectionSpace Travel Basics\nSpacecraft use various types of reaction drives (see\n<em>Spacecraft Propulsion,</em> p. 347), meaning that they burn\nfuel (reaction mass) and direct the heated output in\none direction, which pushes the spacecraft in the opposite\ndirection. Travel over any major distance typically\ninvolves a period of high-acceleration burn for several\nhours at the beginning of the flight, where up to half of\nthe reaction mass is spent to drive up the craft's velocity\nThe ship then coasts for the majority of the flight at\nthat speed, until it approaches its destination, where it\nflips over and burns an equal amount of reaction mass\nin the opposite direction to decrease velocity.\nThough some craft burn half their reaction mass\nto get up to the best speed possible, this doesn't leave\nmuch room for additional maneuvering or emergencies\nMany craft therefore only burn up to a quarter\nor a third of their fuel in initial accelerations, so they\nhave some to spare in case they need it. A few tricks\ncan be used to save fuel and build speed, such as slingshotting\naround the gravity wells of larger planets or\naerobraking in a planet's upper atmosphere.\nTravel times between locations are constantly\nchanging as various bodies move in their orbits\naround the solar system. Within a cluster or planetary\nsystem, travel takes a matter of hours. Within the\n286\ninner system, travel can take days or weeks. Travel to,\nfrom, or within the outer system can take much longer,\nand is usually a matter of several months.\nMost ships operate at zero-g, except for a few larger\ncraft that are able to spin habitat modules for low\ngravity. Periods of high-acceleration also produce\ntemporary gravity in a downward direction, towards\nthe burn.\nSpace is a valuable commodity on board spacecraft,\nso room is often tight. Sleeping and personal quarters\nare rarely bigger than large closets, just enough room\nfor a sleeping bag and personal effects. Depending\non the size of the craft, there may be a communal\nrecreation area. The crew tend to only be busy at the\nbeginning and end of a trip, when they must deal with\nacceleration/deceleration and maneuvering around\nother space traffic. The rest of the trip they spend\ndealing with repairs or otherwise killing time, often\nby accessing XP or VR simulations or playing AR\ngames. While spacecraft have their own local mesh\nnetwork, they are usually too far to interact with the\nmesh networks of other habitats without significant\ncommunications lag, so they must make do with\ntheir own archive of entertainment options. Many\nlong-haul ships are crewed by hibernoid morphs, who\nhunker down for a long nap.\nsubsubsectionSpaceship Combat\nCombat in space tends to take place over long distances\nusing massive beam weapons, railguns, and\nmissiles. It also tends to be nasty, brutish, and short.\nSignificant damage to a vessel can cause atmospheric\ndecompression, killing any biomorph crew who aren't\nsuited up and strapped down.\nFor the most part, it is recommended that space\ncombat be treated as a plot device, part of the background\nstory that helps create drama and tension,\nrather than an event that characters actively participate\nin. This is not to say the characters cannot play a\nrole in the combat, or that their actions will have no\neffect on the outcome. They may become involved in\ndamage control, negotiate with hostile forces, repel\nboarders, target weapons with Gunnery skill, stage a\nmutiny, attempt to hack the networks of approaching\nvessels, escape out the airlock, hide out while the\npirates sack the ship, or similar affairs. It is recommended\nhowever, that gamemasters steer clear of\nspace combat situations that could easily lead to the\nwhole team dying due to a few bad dice rolls."

In more restricted habitats, open\nsource blueprints may be harder to find, as they will\nbe securely hidden from the prying eyes of the authorities\nIn this case, the character will need to use their\nRep to gain access, bribe a local hacker group, or do\nsomething similar.\nNote that restricted nanofabricators may not accept\nopen source blueprints (see <em>Blueprint Restrictions</em>).\nsubsubsectionBlueprint Restrictions\nSome nanofabricators are equipped with pre-programmed\nrestrictions not to accept blueprints for restricted\nitems (such as weapons) or non-licensed items\n(such as black market or open source blueprints).\nThese restrictions may be circumvented by hacking\nthe nanofabricator and re-programming it, following\nnormal hacking rules (p. 254).\nsubsubsectionProgramming Blueprints\nA dedicated character may simply decide to program\ntheir own blueprints, though this is a time-consuming\nendeavor. To do so, the character must make a Programming\n(Nanofabrication) Test with a timeframe\nof one week per cost level of the item. For example, a\nTrivial cost item takes 1 week, a Low cost item takes 2\nweeks, a Moderate item 3 weeks, and so on. Academics\nNanotechnology skill or a skill appropriate to the\nobject's design may be used as a complementary skill\n(p. 173) for this test. A fork or muse may also be assigned\nto such a programming task.\n%%% 287"

That planet is called ‘Mars.'''\n—Professor Magnus Ming, Titan Autonomous University\nendquote\nThe conflict between market capitalism and other forms of economics\nis one of transhumanity's last great culture wars, and it's\nstill being fought. Transhumanity's expansion into the solar system\ncreated myriad opportunities to experiment with new economic systems\nMany failed, but the reputation economies of the outer system\nhave proven both utilitarian and robust in a way that no previous\nchallenger to market capitalism has managed.\nThe reputation economy, sometimes called the gift economy or\nopen economy, is one in which the material plenty created by nanofabrication\nand the longevity granted by uploading and backups\nhave removed considerations of supply versus scarcity from the\neconomic equation—destroying classical economics in the process.\nThe regimented societies of the inner system and the Jovian\nJunta have used societal controls and careful regulation of the\ntechnologies of abundance on their populations, thus keeping to a\ntransitional economy system that is largely an outgrowth of classical\neconomics. No one could get away with doing this in the outer\nsystem. In the Trojans and Greeks, much of the belt, free Jupiter, and\nanywhere outward from Saturn, the reputation economy rules.\nHow did this happen? For one thing, money is a nuisance when\nyou're an autonomous member of an autonomous collective whose\nnearest three neighbors (each 100,000 kilometers away) are also\nautonomous collectives. All of you are almost completely self-sufficient\nin terms of material resources. You have a fleet of robots\nthat harvest water, volatiles, reactor mass, metals, and silicates. You\nhave a nanofabricator to make all of your small items, a community\nfactory for large ones, and a machine shop where you can build\nanything else—with help and advice from an AI with the combined\nknowledge and experience of a top flight engineering team, if you\neven need it. You grow your own food.\n%%% 288\nMoney is for people who don't know how to take\ncare of themselves. Transhumanity is only a few decades\naway from being a mature Type I Kardashev\ncivilization, having largely mastered the material\nresources of its own solar system. A character from\nthe outer system most likely finds the whole concept\nof money an embarrassment.\nHowever, material abundance hasn't eliminated\nthe value of certain goods and services. A transhuman's\nlunch might be free, but innovative ideas, new\ndesigns, health care, sex, and dirty work don't grow\nin fabricators. What if you need gene therapy on your\nmorph to grow infrared sensing cells on your face?\nHow about someone to assassinate your renegade\nbeta fork after she set off a hallucinogen grenade at\nyour gallery opening and kidnapped your boyfriend?\nWhat if you really need a spanking? You call on your\nsocial network. If your network is sufficiently deep\nand numerous, and your reputation is good enough,\nsomeone will help you out.\nIn the inner system, the reputation economy doesn't\nreplace money for the exchange of goods and services,\nbut it does hold sway over the network of favors and\ninfluence. Calling on contacts, getting information,\nand making sure you're in the best place to see and be\nseen all involve calling on your social network."

        "html": "Social networks represent the people you know, and\nthe people they know, and so on. It starts with your\nfriends and family, spreads out to your co-workers,\nneighbors, and colleagues, and expands all the way\nout to your acquaintances, from the neo-hominid\nwaitron at your favorite cafe to the sylph you flirt\nwith at the club. In the always-online, fully-meshed\nuniverse of <em>Eclipse Phase,</em> this goes even further,\nencompassing all of the people you've linked to via\nsocial mesh networks, everyone who watches your\nblog/lifelog/updates, and everyone you interact with\non various mesh forums. Now add in the friend-of-a-friend\nfactor, and everyone has an impressive ability\nto reach out to people they know, people they sort of\nknow, and people you don't know but who are somehow\nlinked to you in one degree or another.\nOf course, social networks are not homogeneous.\nAmong the ever-diversifying ranks of transhumanity,\nthere is a tendency to coalesce around various shared\ncharacteristics, whether those be cultural background,\npersonal interests, professional ties, local connections,\npolitical affiliations, subcultural obsessions, or simply\ncommon interest from being part of the same subspecies\nclade. The social network of an info-anarchist\nhacker is likely to bear little resemblance to that of\na hypercorp socialite or an isolate brinker. Nevertheless\nsocial networks quite frequently overlap, often\nin unexpected and interesting ways. Most people can\nbe considered members of several different types of\nsocial networks. This overlap is what links disparate\ngroupings of transhumans together.\nsubsubsectionNetworking\nJust being connected, of course, doesn't mean you have\nseveral thousand idle transhumans at your beck and\ncall. If you hope to gather the latest gossip, get advice\nfrom an expert, find someone who can fix your problems\nacquire a piece of gray market tech, or spread a\nmeme, you need to know both <em>who</em> to talk to in that\nsocial network and <em>how</em> to go about getting what you\nneed, especially if you hope to keep things quiet and\nnot raise any flags.\nThis is where your Networking: [Field] skills come\nin (p. 182). Networking represents your ability to maneuver\nthrough this web of personal and impersonal\nconnections to find who and what you need. This\ncould be handled by word-of-mouth, posting the right\nqueries in the right places on the mesh, monitoring\nthe right personal profiles and forums, harnessing the\npower of the mob with crowdsourcing, or any number\nof similar creative tactics.\nEach field you have in Networking represents a\nparticular network grouping, a common interest that\nties people together. Most of these fields are based\non factions (Autonomists, Hypercorp, etc.) and tie\ninto a special reputation network (see the Reputation\nNetworks table, p. 287). At the gamemaster's discretion\nother groupings of people could be connected\nthrough these skills and rep systems. For example,\nartists and journalists of all stripes can fall under\nthe Networking: Media skill and f-rep, no matter if\nthey are autonomist or hypercorp. Likewise, being a\ndiverse group, brinkers do not universally fall into any\nof the categories, and are instead spread out between\nthem. If the gamemaster and players agree, other\nNetworking fields and rep networks may be added,\nrepresenting other spheres of interest, such as AR\nGames, Sports, Slash Fiction, etc.\nThe exact uses for which you may exploit your social\nnetworks are noted below. While in some cases the defining\nelement is who you know and how good you are\nat reaching out to them, in others the defining element\nis how known <em>you</em> are. You might be connected to\nthousands of people, but if you don't have clout, your\nefforts to make use of these connections is limited. This\nis where Reputation comes into play."

The standard level of favor\nyou can expect to get from a social network is based\non your level of Rep in that network. If you want to\npursue a favor above your level, you can do so, but\nyou will suffer a negative modifier on your Networking\nTest. This reflects that someone with low standing\nhas a hard time getting people to go out of their way\nfor them.

She has a specific weapon in\nmind, but it’s pricey—its cost is High. She decides\nher best approach is to try talking to the scum on\nthe ship to try and find someone who can lend or\nsell her such a weapon, using her @-rep and her\nNetworking: Autonomist skill of 50. Acquiring a\nHigh cost item counts as a Level 4 High favor (see\nAcquire/Unloads Goods, p. 289). Jaqui’s @-rep\nis 53, which is only Level 3. Since the favor is one\nlevel higher than her rep level, she suffers a –10\nmodifier on her Networking Test. Jaqui must roll a\n40 or less (50 – 10) to find a weapon supplier.\nendquotation\n%%%% 290\nsubsubsectionPaying/Exchanging For Favors\nFavors don't necessarily come for free. Depending on\nwhat you're after, you may also need to exchange for it.\nIn the capitalist and transitional economies of the\ninner system and Jovian Junta, you may need to buy\nthe goods or services you are after with credit. Even information\nmight be paid for by bribing the right person.\nOnce spent, that credit is gone until you earn more.\nIn the anarchistic reputation economies of the outer\nsystem, you can get what you need for free. In this\ncase, you are acquiring goods and services based on\nthe strength of your reputation.\nbeginquotation\nJaqui rolls a 39—she makes it! After posting some\npublic notices on the scum social network (she’s\nnot worried about legalities or hiding what she’s\ndoing—this is a scum ship after all), she gets directed\nto a weapons dealer with a good rep. While\na scum arms merchant normally sells their wares\nfor credit, Jaqui is scum herself, so she’s able to use\nher scum community standing and get the weapon\nfor free. This uses up a High favor, however.\nendquotation\nsubsubsectionThe Limits Of Reputation\nEven in the gift economies, reputation only gets you so\nfar. There are limits to how often you can ask for help\nbefore you start coming across as pushy or a leech. In\ngame terms, this is expressed as a <em>refresh rate</em>—the\namount of time you must wait to pass before you can\nseek out a favor of that level again without seeming\ndemanding. Refresh rates are noted on the Favors\ntable (p. 289).\nIf you need to seek another favor before the refresh\nrate has expired, you have two choices. You can\nexpend a higher level favor instead, keeping in mind\nthat higher level favors refresh more slowly. Alternatively\nyou can burn reputation (see below).\nbeginquotation\nNow that Jaqui’s got her weapon, she needs\nanother favor—she needs to find someone who\ndoesn’t want to be found. The person she’s after is\nscum, so once again she turns to the scum for help.\nThe gamemaster decides that this is another Level\n4 favor (see Acquire Information, p. 291). Once\nagain, with her Networking: Autonomist of 50 and\nLevel 3 rep, she must roll a 40 or less. She gets a\n21, and finds someone who has the information\nshe needs.\nJaqui now has a choice. To get this information,\nshe either needs to pay the person in credits (a\nHigh cost) or she she needs to expend another\nLevel 4 favor. She’s low on money, so she decides\nto use her rep again. Level 4 favors only refresh\nonce a month, though, and Jaqui used her last one\njust a few hours ago. Her only choice is to expend\na higher favor, so she expends a Level 5 to get the\nintel she needs.\nendquotation\nsubsubsectionBurning Reputation\nIn some cases, getting what you need may be more\nimportant than not stepping on people's tentacles. In\nsituations of dire need, you can <em>burn </em>some of your\nRep score to get the job done, meaning that you exchange\na loss of Rep for a shot at a favor. This reflects\nthat you are pushing the bounds of how far people are\nwilling to go for you. While you still might get what\nyou need, your online reputation rating takes a hit as\npeople flag you for being needy.\nThere are two reasons to burn Rep score. The first\nis to get a bonus on your Networking Test. This indicates\nthat you are pulling strings and calling in markers\nto get the favor you're after. This is particularly\nuseful when you are trying to obtain a favor that's of\na level higher than your Rep, but abuse it too often\nand you will soon have no social standing at all. Every\npoint of Rep you burn gives you an equivalent positive\nmodifier on the Networking Test, up to a maximum\nof +30.\nThe second option is to burn Rep to seek a favor\nbefore it has refreshed. This reflects that you are asking\nfor too much in a short period. The amount of Rep\nyou must burn in this case depends on the level of favor\nyou are seeking, as noted on the Favors table (p. 289).\nbeginquotation\nJaqui’s got her weapon and her target’s whereabouts,\nbut she needs one more thing: a hacker.\nShe needs someone who can open some doors\nand defeat some security systems so she can get\nto the target she’s after in his hideout. Since she’s\non a scum barge, Jaqui feels that, once again, her\nbest option is to work her scum contacts. The\ngamemaster determines that this will be another\nLevel 4 favor. Rolling against a target number of\n40 again, she gets a 13—her luck is holding.\nShe finds a hacker, but now she needs to make\nan exchange for their services. Once again she\ndecides not to spend credit and use her @-rep\ninstead. Jaqui’s already used up both her Level 4\nand Level 5 @-rep favors, though, so she has no\nchoice but to burn reputation. A Level 4 favor costs\n10 Rep to burn. Jaqui spends it, sending her @-rep\nfrom 53 to 43—she’s been pulling in a lot of big\nfavors in a short amount of time, and her friends\nand acquaintances are expressing their annoyance\nby lowering her social standing.\nendquotation\nsubsubsectionKeeping Quiet\nThe problem with using social networks for favors is\nthat you end up letting lots of other people know what\nyou're up to. When you're involved in a clandestine\noperation, that could be exactly what you <em>don't</em> want.\nThe only way to diminish this is to take your requests\nto trusted friends and ask them to keep quiet, but this\ndiminishes the pool of people at your disposal.\n%%% 291\nIn game terms, you can try to keep word of what\nyou're doing quiet, but this makes it harder to get\nwhat you need. For every negative modifier you apply\nto your Networking Test, the same negative modifier\napplies to anyone making a Networking Test to find\nout what you're up to.\nbeginquotation\nRevisiting one of our previous examples, we go\nback to the point where Jaqui was trying to\nascertain someone’s hideout location. Because\nthe person she’s after is scum, they’re on a\nscum ship, and Jaqui is using her Networking:\nAutonomist skill to find them, there’s a good\nchance that if she starts asking around to everyone,\nword might trickle back to the person\nshe’s after. She doesn’t want them to know\nshe’s on their tail, though, so she decides to\nmake her inquiries more discreet. She applies\na –20 modifier to her Networking Test, which\nlowers her target number from 40 to 20. As\nnoted before, she rolls a 21, which is a failure.\nShe spends a Moxie point to flip the roll,\nthough, making it a 12—a success.\nBecause Jaqui took that –20 hit, representing\nthe fact that she was keeping her research\nquiet, her target will suffer a –20 modifier\nwhen he makes his Networking Test to see if\nhe gets word that someone is asking around\nabout his hideout.\nendquotation"

        "html": "Firewall sentinels make a regular habit of being in\nplaces where they are not supposed to be and bringing\nthings with them that others would prefer they\nnot have. Security has a different character post-Fall\nthan in the 21st century. Due to hyper-abundance,\nphysical security measures such as locks, doors, and\nwalls are less important than in the past to common\ncitizens. People don't worry about theft as much as\nin the past because most items can be replaced by a\nnanofabricator. The items that do tend to engender\nthis type of security are irreplaceable or rare items\nsuch as artifacts of Earth.\nPost-Fall physical security focuses heavily on\nsurveillance—identifying intruders and tracking\nthem so that they can be interdicted by transhuman\nor robotic defenders. Surveillance is more effective\nthan in pre-Fall societies because AIs with\nnear-human faculties of pattern recognition and\nindentured infomorphs can be employed to monitor\nsurveillance data.\nThe emphasis on surveillance results from the ease\nwith which most material barriers can be breached\nby high-powered hand weaponry and devices like\nthe covert operations tool (p. 315). However, physical\nbarriers designed to actively resist intruders by\nhealing themselves or attacking tools used to damage\nthem are used at key points in secure installations.\nSuch barriers are typically very expensive and so are\nused sparingly.\nTranshuman, animal, and infolife defenders are\ncornerstones of most security systems. The availability\nof a huge pool of infomorph labor to guard\nfacilities means that someone is always on duty,\nwhether as part of the surveillance system or in a\nrobotic shell."

        "title": "Access Control",
        "html": "The first step in any security system is simply to enact\nmeasure to keep unwanted people out. At a basic level\nthis involves walls, locks, fencing, defensive landscaping\nsecurity lighting, and entoptic warnings.\nBarriers of different sorts present an obstacle that\nmust be cut through or blown apart in order to\ndefeat. Barriers are treated just like other inanimate\nobjects for purposes of attack sand damage; see <em>Ob-</em>\n<em>jects and Structures,</em> p. 202.\nsubsubsectionBug Zappers\nBug zappers create minute EMP pulses that are harmless\nto most electronic equipment and implants but\nwreak havoc on nanobot swarms, microbugs, and\nspecks. Bug zappers are generally applied to surfaces,\nand as such they only destroy floating/flying swarms\nor specks if they land. In areas with heavily shielded\nelectronics, they may be installed to destroy targets\nin an entire room. A zapper instantly destroys all\nfree-crawling or flying nanobots and specks in a room\nwhen it goes off, but transhuman flesh is sufficient to\nprevent it destroying medichines or other implanted\nnanobots. Infiltrators trying to gather data in areas\nprotected by zappers generally resort to going around\nthem or trying to plant macroscale devices.\nsubsubsectionElectronic Locks\nElectronic locks (e-locks) are commonly used as a\nmeans of maintaining privacy. They are easy to defeat,\nhowever, and so are rarely used in very secure areas.\nE-locks have several advantages over old-fashioned\nmechanical locks. Different users can have different\nauthentication methods, they can log all events (entry,\nexit, failed authentications), and they can be connected\n(usually hardwired but sometimes encrypted\nwireless) to security systems for remote control and\nalarm triggering.\nE-locks use one of several authentication systems,\nor sometimes a combination of systems:\n<strong>Biometric:</strong> The lock scans one or more of the user's\nbiometric prints. Common biometrics include DNA,\nfacial thermographic, fingerprint, gait, hand veins, iris,\nkeystroke, odor, palm, retinal, and voice prints.\n<strong>Keypad:</strong> This is an alphanumeric keypad upon\nwhich users enter a specific code. Different users can\nhave different codes.\n<strong>Token:</strong> Authorized users must carry some sort of\nphysical token that interacts with the lock to open the\ndoor, such as a keycard, electronic key, etc.\n<strong>Wireless Code:</strong> Users must emit a cryptographic\ncode via near-proximity wireless signal.\nThough various technologies exist to defeat each\nof these systems, there are three methods that work\nagainst almost all e-locks. The first is use of a covert\noperations tool (p. 315), which infiltrates a lock with\nnanobots that swarm in and engage the electronic\nmechanism. The drawback to using a COT is that its\nuse is immediately logged by the e-lock and an alarm\nis triggered. Some e-locks are equipped with guardian\nnanoswarms (p. 329) to defeat COTs, but the COT\nnanobots usually manage to open the lock before the\nguardians eat them.\nThe second method is to hack the e-lock. Most\ne-locks are slaved to a security system, so this often\nmeans intruding into the security system and then\nopening the lock from within. This can be difficult,\nhowever, especially if the security system is wirelessly\nisolated or hardwired. The advantage is that,\nif done right, all evidence of the lock being opened\ncan be erased.\nThe third method is to physically open and manipulate\nthe lock. This requires first opening the\nlock's case and then triggering the lock mechanism\nto open the door. Both of these are handled as\nseparate Hardware: Electronics Task Actions with\na timeframe of 1 minute each. In addition, most e-locks\nhave anti-tamper circuits that will set off an\nalarm if the attacker does not achieve an Excellent\nSuccess when opening the case.\n%%% 294\nsubsubsectionLockbots\nThe 21st century saw a move from mechanical\nlocks to e-locks and other largely electronic locking\nmechanisms. These devices worked well for about\n50 years, until electronic infiltration  capabilities\nrendered them largely useless. The more recent development\nof lockbots has more in common with\ntheir early mechanical forebears. They are unique,\nexpensive, artisan items.\nA typical lockbot is heavily integrated with the\nportal and barrier it protects. Lockbots usually\ninclude an AI or indentured infomorph, self-healing\nmaterials (treat as a self-healing barrier), and a\nswarm of guardian nanobots (p. 329). A lockbot\nmonitors its surroundings and has visual recognition\nsoftware that knows what its users and its keys\nlook like (Perception skill 40). Picking a lockbot is\nthus incredibly difficult, because it will shut its orifice\nand not accept a key that doesn't look right or\nthat comes from an unrecognized user. Unfamiliar\nnanobots trying to enter the orifice are targeted and\ndestroyed by the guardian nanobots. Finally, external\ntools used to harm the portal or the lock will be\nattacked by fractal appendages extruded from the\nportal surface or the lock itself. These appendages\nhave a range of 1 meter, attack with skill of 40, and\ninflict 1d10 +2 DV.\nLockbots are generally immune to being hacked\nbecause, for security, they aren't connected to\nthe mesh. If attacked, however, lockbots are programmed\nto send out an alarm signal via the mesh.\nThere are several ways to defeat a lockbot. One\nis to get a copy or image of the key and then forge\na copy (using nanofabrication). Another is to attack\nthe lockbot or the portal it guards with so much\nforce that the lockbot is unable to repair it (usually\nusing ranged weapons, as anything within a meter\nof a lockbot may be counterattacked). A third is to\nsomehow image the cavity beyond the lockbot's orifice\nwithout the imaging device being destroyed and\nto then forge the key. All of these are difficult and\ntime-consuming processes.\nSome lockbots have the ability to destroy what\nthey're protecting. For example, lockbots are a\ncommon protection for the physical interfaces to\nhardwired networks. If the lockbot is compromised,\nit may, as a last resort, destroy the interface it was\nprotecting.\nsubsubsectionPortal Denial System\nInstalled in corridors or doorways, this is essentially\na laser trap device. When an unauthorized person\nenters the portal denial system's area, it uses lasers\nto create a grid of plasma channels that are used to\ndeliver a powerful electric current to the target. This\nsystem has both lethal and nonlethal settings.\n<strong>Nonlethal:</strong> 1d10 DV + shock (p. 204)\n<strong>Lethal:</strong> 2d10 +5 DV\nsubsubsectionSelf-Healing Barriers\nWalls and doors that are able to rapidly repair themselves\nare sometimes found in high security installations\nThese barriers are made of materials that\nautomatically expand to \"heal\" small holes and that\nare equipped with nanosystems that slowly repair\nlarger amounts of damage. The best of these barriers\ndo no more than slow down the most determined\nassailants, but in combination with surveillance systems\nthey are a nuisance to invaders and can slow\ndown attempts to flee the scene.\nSelf-healing barriers heal any single source of\ndamage that is less than 5 points of damage almost\nimmediately, sealing the hole in 1 Action Turn. They\nwill also seal the holes inflicted by a covert ops\ntool (p. 315) in the same time period. Additionally,\nthese barriers repair larger themselves at the rate of\n1d10 damage per 2 hours; once all damage is fixed\nany wounds are repaired at the rate of 1 per day.\nDamage of 3 wounds or more may not be repaired\nby self-healing.\nsubsubsectionSlippery Walls\nOn planetary surfaces, high walls and fences are still\ncommon as a first line of defense against interlopers\nSlippery walls are surface treated with the slip\nchemical (p. 323), creating a virtually frictionless\nsurface that is exceptionally difficult to climb.\nsubsubsectionWireless Inhibitors\nWireless inhibitors are simple paint jobs or construction\nmaterials that block radio signals. They are\nused to create a contained area in which a wireless\nnetwork may operate freely without worry that the\nsignals will escape out of the area, where they can\nbe intercepted. Wireless inhibitors allow the convenience\nof using wireless links within a secure area\nrather than the clumsier hardwired connections. If\nan intruder manages to gain access inside the area,\nhowever, they can intercept, sniff, and hack wireless\ndevices as normal."

        "html": "Should security measures fail to keep an intruder\nout, the second step is to detect an interloper and\ntrack their activity.\nsubsubsectionNanotagging\nA lot of post-Fall security centers not around keeping\npeople out of private spaces, but tracking them after\nthey come and go. What little privacy transhumans\nhave, they cherish. Trespassing is a worse offense\nthan theft in many places.\nA room protected by a taggant nanoswarm (p. 329)\nusually has two or more hives, one each at floor and\nceiling level (if in gravity; on the opposite side of the\nroom if in microgravity) that generate and recycle\nnanobots. The taggants emerge from one hive, float\nthrough the room, and then return to the other for\nrecharging and reuse. A feed line usually connects the\n%%% 295\nhives so that they can share materials and power.\nAnyone passing through the room is likely to be\ndosed with taggant nanobots. Once they lose proximity\nto the rest of the hive, they hide and periodically\nbroadcast pulsed transmissions meant to give their position\nto pursuers or investigators. Some may drop off\nin clusters to form a breadcrumb trail to the interloper.\nsubsubsectionSensors\nAny of the various sensors described in the <em>Gear</em>\nchapter (p. 294) may be deployed within a facility\nto monitor and record the passage of personnel,\nboth authorized and not. These sensors are typically\nslaved to the facility's security network and closely\nmonitored by security AIs, meaning they are vulnerable\nto hacking and possibly jamming. A few other\nsensor types deserve mention here:\n<strong>Chemical Sniffers:</strong> The chem sniffer described on\np. 311 can also be set to detect the carbon dioxide\nexhaled in transhuman breaths. This is useful for\ndetecting intruding biomorphs in areas that are\nabandoned/off-limits.\n<strong>Electrical Sensors:</strong> Electrical sensors can be set in\nportals to detect a biomorph's electromagnetic field\nin addition to the electrical fields of synthmorphs.\n<strong>Heartbeat Sensors:</strong> These sensitive sensors detect\nthe vibration caused by transhuman heart beats.\nThey can even be used to detect the heartbeats of\npassengers inside a large vehicle.\n<strong>Seismic Sensors:</strong> Embedded in flooring, these sensors\npick up the pressure and vibration of weight\nand movement.\nsubsubsectionWeapon Scanners\nWeapon scanners come in several varieties, including\nthose that look for the rare elements used in\nextremely destructive weapons such as nukes, those\nthat attempt to locate personal weaponry, and those\nthat look for detection taggants.\nRare element scanners are nearly flawless and are\nubiquitous in habitat customs and spaceports. The\nonly way to circumvent them is to find an alternate\nroute into the protected area.\nPersonal weapon scanners can monitor a specific\narea, such as a small room or doorway. They use\na number of sensing systems to detect and identify\nweapons and other dangerous objects, including\nchemical sniffers and radar/terahertz/infrared/x-ray/ultrasound imaging. They can detect the following\nitems and substances:\nbeginitemize\n• Metal used in kinetic weapons, seekers, and flechette weapons\n• Devices with onboard hives of metallic nano- bots (e.g., covert operations tools, spindles)\n• Magnetic elements in plasma guns and railguns\n• Propellant from firearms ammunition and seekers (–30 to conceal)\n• Chemical fuels used in torch spray weapons (–30 to conceal)\n• All explosives and grenades by their chemical particulate emissions (–30 to conceal)\n• Poisons and bioagents in flechette weapons\n• Any weapon or device larger than palm size (using sound waves and shape recognition)\nenditemize\nCharacters trying to sneak weapons and gear past\npersonal weapon scanners must make a Palming\nTest (if concealing) or an Infiltration\nTest (if somehow maneuvering around\nwithout notice). This is opposed by a\nPerception Test from the character or\nAI manning the sensor system.\nsubsubsectionWireless Scanning\nSome high-security areas will intentionally\nmonitor for wireless\nradio signals originating within\ntheir area as a way of detecting\nintruders by their communications\nemissions. These\nsignals can even be used to\ntrack the intruder's location via\ntriangulation and other means\n(see  <em>Physical Tracking,</em> p. 251).\nTo bypass wireless detection systems\ncovert operatives can use\nline-of-sight laser links (p. 313)\nfor communication or touch-based\nskinlinks (p. 309)."

While live transhuman\nguards are sometimes\nused, robotic sentries are more\ncommon, typically AI-driven\nsynthmorphs such as synths,\nslitheroids, arachnoids, or\nreapers, with guardian angels\n(p. 346) providing air support.\nOccasionally AI-operated gun\nemplacements—armored turrets\nthat pop out of walls and\nceilings—are also applied. In\nsome circumstances, these shells\nare teleoperated or even jammed\nby transhuman security.\nAdditional countermeasures\nbrought to bear will depend on the facility\nin question.
