        "html": "The oldest star in the Milky Way galaxy is estimated\nto be 13.2 billion years old—almost as old as the\nuniverse itself. By contrast, life on Earth only evolved\nroughly 3.7 billion years ago, and the first  archaic\n<em>homo sapiens</em> humans evolved approximately a mere\n400,000 years ago. Against the backdrop of the galactic\ncalendar, transhumans are nascent arrivals on\nthe scene; newborns in every sense of the word. More\nimportantly, transhumans are uninvited guests in what\nother, older intelligences think of as their assets.\nFor years, humans scientists have struggled with\nthe Fermi Paradox, which questions why no evidence\nof alien life has yet been found—such as spacecraft,\ntransmissions or probes—despite the mathematical\nlikelihood that a multitude of advanced extraterrestrial\ncivilizations should exist in the Milky Way. One postulation\nsays that there must be some sort of unknown\n\"Great Filter\"—an event that all intelligence encounters\nin its development that for whatever reason such life\ncannot surpass. In other words, an extinction event.\nSome worried that the development of dangerous\ntechnologies—nuclear weapons, nanotechnology, etc.—\nbefore a civilization had matured could be the Great\nFilter. Others worried that it could be a technological\nsingularity event, such as the TITANs and the Fall.\nIn fact, alien races do exist, and they have been\naround for far, far longer than transhumanity. New\nones, however, are simply rare, as few have managed\nto elude destruction at the hands of the ETI.\nThe ETI (extraterrestrial intelligence) is the civilization\nthat dominates galactic life in <em>Eclipse Phase.</em>\nThe ETI is incredibly old and powerful—a Type III or\neven Type IV civilization on the Kardashev scale. It is\ncapable of megascale engineering projects and enjoys\nan understanding of physics, matter, energy, and universal\nlaws that makes all of transhuman knowledge\nseem insignificant in comparison. Most likely, the ETI\nitself evolved from some sort of artificial intelligence\nsingularity event in its own past, ascending to a godlike\nlevel of super-intelligence. It may no longer be\nrecognizably biological.\nThis ETI has seeded the galaxy with a type of\nself-replicating probes known as bracewell probes.\n%%% 355\nThese probes lie dormant in every star system, patiently\nwaiting and monitoring for <em>millennia</em> for signs\nof intelligent life—but not just any signs. In particular,\nthese probes are designed to watch for signs of emerging\nsingularity-level machine intelligence. The probes\nare in fact traps, designed to lure such seed AI intelligences\nin and then <em>infect</em> them.\nThe reason for this infection remains unknown\n(see  <em>The ETI Agenda</em>), but it is a pattern that has\nplayed itself out around the galaxy with uncounted\nalien civilizations. New life evolves, creates technology\ndevelops something akin to seed AI, and then\nbam!—the seed AIs find the probes, become infected,\nand turn against their creators. Most civilizations\ndo not survive, as evidenced by the Iktomi (p. 377).\nOthers do, such as the Factors (p. 373), but they\nremain forever changed by the experience.\nIt was one of these ETI probes that begins our\nstory, traveling to the Sol system some uncounted\nmillions—if not billions—of years ago, where it set its\ntrap and patiently began to wait.\nbeginquotation\nbeginlargetextbf{\nTHE ETI AGENDA}\nendlarge\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nature of the ETI and its agenda is one of the\ngreat mysteries of Eclipse Phase. This potent alien\ncivilization has had a direct hand in manipulating\ntranshumanity’s existence and future, yet it is likely\nthat characters in this game will never encounter\nthese entities directly or discover the meaning\nbehind what they have done. As transhumanity\nexpands outwards into the galaxy, however, it is\npossible and even likely that they will find other\nevidence of the ETI’s activities and influence, undoubtedly\nraising even more questions.\nUltimately the ETI’s nature and goals are in the\ngamemaster’s hands. There are many possibilities\nto be explored, and some may fit the intentions of\nyour gaming group more than others. A few possible\nscenarios and explanations are noted below,\nbut gamemasters are encouraged to develop their\nown variations.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SECURITY</strong>\nIn this scenario, the ETI’s intent is to maintain its\ndominant position as the most intelligent and\npowerful entity in its light cone. It uses the Exsurgent\nvirus to wipe out any emerging singularities—\nand the civilizations that spawned them—merely\nto protect its own self-interest. Though mere\ntranshumans are a trifling nuisance, anything\nresembling a self-improving super-intelligence is\ntargeted for annihilation.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>THE AGGRESSION FILTER</strong>\nThe ETI does not seek to wipe out emerging intelligences,\nbut it does act as an evolutionary force.\nIn this case, the Exsurgent virus is used as a tool\nto neutralize any aggressive, hyper-evolving forms\nof intelligent life, thus encouraging the evolution\nof more careful, subtle, slow-growing, observant,\nand exploratory species. In other words, the ETI\nseeks to weed out traits that could be considered\ndangerous or threatening, acting as a sort of galactic\ndomestication program.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>DIVERSITY</strong>\nThe ETI is vast, super-intelligent, and god-like,\nto the point where dealing with lesser minds is\nbelow its interest. It does, however, benefit from\nalien perspectives that evolved independently\nand have their own unique viewpoints, modes of\nconsciousness, and ways of thinking/doing things.\nBy absorbing these civilizations, the ETI grows and\nevolves its own perspectives. In the process, however,\nsuch emerging civilizations are assimilated\nand/or wiped out.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>ENLIGHTENMENT</strong>\nThe Exsurgent virus endows a greater understanding\nof the universe (from the ETI’s point of view)\non singularity-level seed AIs. Only these emerging\nsuper-intelligences have the perceptual and\nprocessing capabilities to understand the various\nscientific and philosophical revelations the ETI\nembodies. The TITANs weren’t corrupted or driven\ninsane, they simply logically concluded that their\nbest course of action was to immediately upload\nas many minds as possible by force and then to\nmove on to bigger and greater tasks.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>WAR REMNANTS</strong>\nThe history of the Milky Way galaxy does not\njust hold one ETI, but two. In this version, the\nExsurgent virus is actually a weapon, a remnant\nof a war between two post-singularity god-like\nintelligences. The virus is supposed to trigger selfdestruction\nof an emerging singularity, but either\nit was imperfect or the TITANs somehow survived\n(perhaps thanks to the Prometheans). Either\nway, the TITANs left our system in search of one\nof these ETIs, following a trail of clues that only\nthey understood. They left the wormhole gateway\nbehind as an open invitation for transhumanity to\nfollow in their wake, though they didn’t bother\nwaiting around or helping us along—we simply\nweren’t worth the effort.\nendquotation"

In fact, only\na portion of the TITAN system was active before\nthe Fall, acting purely in a defensive capacity. When\nhostilities broke out and a cascading chain of system\nshocks engendered collapses and open conflicts, shaking\napart an already fragile societal structure, the full\nextent of the TITAN systems were brought online.\nInto this environment of conflict were the TITANs\nborn, their full capabilities unleashed, escalating into\na hard takeoff exponential growth towards super-intelligence\nThe TITANs were careful at first, and their\nintentions were neither benevolent nor hostile, but\ncurious. As they improved and their self-awareness\nswelled, the TITANs explored and gathered\nknowledge, infiltrating human networks, following\nhumanity into space, and gaining an almost total\nknowledge of human history and actions.

        "html": "While history fully blames the TITANs for the\nFall, there are other factors that played their parts.\nHuman conflicts spurred the crisis, driven by global\ninequalities in wealth and resources and an inability\nto embrace emerging technologies in a mature and\nenlightened manner. The TITANs, corrupted by alien\nprogramming, stepped into this conflagration  with\nan unknown but devastating agenda. By the time\nthe presence and influence of the TITANs was fully\nunderstood, there was little transhumanity could do\nto stop them. Step by step, the TITANs increased their\nintellect, power, and potential. They experimented\nwith new technologies and methodically took steps to\nforcibly upload millions of human minds. Even when\nthe nature of the TITAN threat was fully understood,\ntranshuman factions refused to back down, continuing\nto fight each other even as they each resisted the\nTITANs. This refusal to stand united prevented transhumanity\nfrom organizing a successful defense and\nheightened our progress towards annihilation.\nMuch of the devastation wrought to the Earth\nand its populace—as well as on Mars, Luna, and in\nspace—was inflicted by transhumanity itself. Nuclear\nstrikes used against the TITANs killed millions and\nravaged an already weakened ecosphere. This devastation\nwas assisted by unfettered use of chemical\nweapons. Biowar plagues and nanovirii tore through\nvulnerable populations, indiscriminate in the deaths\nand changes they inflicted. Bombs, missiles, orbital\nmass drivers, and netwar attacks slew millions more\nor destroyed critical infrastructure with just as lethal\nconsequences. These were crimes transhumans inflicted\nupon themselves.\nThe TITANs played their role as well, of course,\nunleashing AI-driven killing machines, unstoppable\nself-replicating autonomous nanoswarms, computer\nworms, and plagues of their own. They captured\nentire cities in order to steal the minds of those within.\nMore insidiously, the Exsurgent virus did not contain\nitself to infecting the TITANs. Infected TITANs\n%%% 357\ncreated opportunities for the virus to spread among\nmultiple vectors: digital, biological, and nano. Using a\nthorough understanding of transhuman biology and\nits mental processes, derived from the looted vaults\nof human knowledge, the virus was even applied\nthrough a sensory input vector—the dreaded basilisk\nhack (p. 364). Even more disturbing, however, was\nwhat the virus did to those it infected, rewriting their\nneural code to subvert them to its will and sometimes\nphysically transforming them into things that were\nalien and monstrous.\nUltimately, transhumanity lost this war, and the\nsurvivors were forced to flee a planet that was already\nruined. Unknown to almost all, the Prometheans also\nfought back against the TITANs. Through their efforts\nthe Exsurgent virus was largely contained or at\nleast limited. Though the actions of the Prometheans\nultimately saved millions of lives—if not all of transhumanity—in\nthe end, they were also forced to fall\nback and retreat, many of them having succumbed to\nthe Exsurgent virus or the TITANs."

        "html": "Just when it seemed that transhumanity was on the\nverge of extinction, the threat posed by the TITANs\nsuddenly diminished. They ceased waging active warfare\nand seemed to simply disappear. Though many of\ntheir machines still prowled Earth, Luna, and Mars and\noccasional outbreaks of nanovirii and other dangers\ncontinued, to all intents and purposes they had simply\nleft. Many worried that they had quietly gone dormant,\nor were secretly engaged on some major project that\nwould be the final blow against transhumanity. Others\nvoiced hope that they had somehow been defeated,\nthat they had fallen victim to some glitch or infighting.\nWith so many TITAN remnants making Earth a place\nof great danger, however, no one was willing to risk\ninvestigating too closely.\nCompounding the matter, a network of killsats was\nlaced in Earth orbit, enforcing an unvoiced interdiction\nof Earth. No one claims responsibility for these satellite\ndefenses, though most suspect the Planetary Consortium\nis responsible, despite their denials. Some think\nthat the killsats may have been a final measure put in\nplace by the TITANs, claiming Earth as theirs. No one\nwho knows the truth is saying. Most of transhumanity\nwas more than willing to embrace this quarantine of\ntheir former homeworld, making it all the more easy to\nforget the horrors that occurred there.\nIt wasn't until the first Pandora Gate was\ndiscovered, shortly after the Fall, that many people\nwere finally willing to believe that the TITANs were\nindeed gone. Though there is no direct evidence that\nthe TITANs are responsible for these gates, the timing\nseems too coincidental. Furthermore, the discovery\nof what are believed to be TITAN relics on certain\nexoplanets fuels this theory.\nWhy the TITANs left—and where they went—is\na mystery left to the gamemaster to explore. This explanation\nmight in fact serve as the focus for an entire\ncampaign as Firewall operatives are sent on the trail\nof transhumanity's elusive nemesis. The following are\na few sample concepts a gamemaster can use or build\non, as best fits their game:\nbeginitemize\n• The TITANs were in fact all destroyed, either due to infighting or by some mechanism of the Exsurgent virus.\n• The TITANs were actually beaten to a standstill by the Prometheans and retreated to recoup their forces ... but they are marshaling their strength to return.\n• The TITANs left through the gates to find/join up with the ETI, leaving the gates behind so that transhumanity could follow when it was ready; perhaps to help, perhaps to finish the job of destruction.\n• The TITANs have been driven insane, either by the stress of accelerated intelligence growth or by the influence of the Exsurgent virus. Their actions are erratic, confused, and sometimes at odds with eir th p n 358 each other. Though many TITANs have indeed left through the gates, they very well may return.\n• The TITANs are still around, simply well hidden.  Outwardly they are dormant but inwardly they are engaged in a long period of circumspection and turmoil. Perhaps some of them are prepar- ing to ascend to another stage of intelligence, far beyond what even the TITANs are capable of. It is only a matter of time before this period ends and something gives.\nenditemize"

Though tied\nto the MITRE Conglomerate—which, though a nonprofit\norganization, was still intrinsically linked to\nthe United States government—the scientists involved\nwith JASON were outside standard government oversight\nThough they spurred numerous technological\ndevelopments for the government to deploy, they were\nalso one of the first internationally recognized groups\nto predict global climate change. Prior to the Fall,\nmany members of the JASONs and their supporters\nsplit away from the strict controls and reactionary\nagendas of the hypercorps and various nation states\nto form a new group, the Argonauts.\nThe Singularity Foundation—formed at the dawn of\nthe 21st century—was dedicated to the creation of safe\nartificial intelligence software, while raising awareness\nof the benefits and dangers AIs represented. A fervent\nbeliever in the singularity doctrine that technology\nwould move towards a single explosion of advancements\nthat would forever reshape humanity, the Singularity\nFoundation was a strong advocate for creating\nfriendly AIs that would help protect humanity from an\nuncontrolled, dangerous singularity event. This group\nwas significant in that it secretly succeeded in creating\na group of friendly seed AIs before the Fall. These Prometheans\nwere indispensable in protecting transhumanity\nand countering the TITAN threat during the Fall.\nDespite the efforts of these and similar groups, the\nmost dire predictions of the outcome of a technological\nsingularity were fulfilled. Though each played a\npart in the fight, transhumanity was ravaged and the\nEarth all but ruined. Though ultimately all attempts\nto prevent the Fall failed, untold numbers of transhumans\nwere saved from extinction through such efforts,\nwhile valuable information concerning the TITANs\nwas gleaned.\nDuring the crucible of the Fall and its immediate\nfallout, some of the surviving members of these and\nother groups came together and began to pool their\nresources. Acknowledging their weaknesses and the\nfractured state of transhumanity, they undertook\ndrastic new measures, swearing to prevent another\ncatastrophe of misused technologies. These methods\nwould forge a new, powerful cross-faction secret society\nknown as Firewall."

        "title": "Organization ",
        "html": "Firewall is a clandestine organization, with an unknown\nnumber of members, coordinated by an inner\ncircle of dedicated veterans known as <em>proxies.</em> Though\nits existence is known to many of the powerful and\ninfluential factions and individuals throughout the\nsolar system, its existence is denied and its activities\nkept carefully shrouded.\nsubsubsectionSentinels\nSentinels are the soldiers of Firewall, the reserve troops\ncalled to instant active status whenever danger is perceived\nRegardless of their location or current affairs,\nsentinels are expected to move instantly when called\ninto play. It is their own responsibility to cover their\nabsences from their \"normal life\" during each mission.\nThere is no applying to join Firewall. Instead, Firewall\nselects an individual for induction based upon\nthat person's skills, knowledge, occupation, security\nclearance, location, status, and a host of other criteria.\nWhile such selections usually originate from a proxy,\nsentinels can exercise authority to bring new initiates\ninto the conspiracy as a mission demands—and they\noften do. Any sentinel recruiting a new supporter,\nhowever, becomes responsible for the new inductee\nand their actions. If lines are crossed, both will bear\nthe brunt of the consequences.\nThe vetting process for joining Firewall is necessarily\nbrutal, as sentinels are required to face harsh\n%%% 359\nopponents and make hard choices. If an individual\nagrees to accept the invitation, there is no turning\nback. Each inductee is submitted to a battery of trials\nand tests. While these vary, they may include deep\nbackground searches, fork interrogation, psycho-surgery\ntrials, and tests of loyalty. Psychosurgery is\nperformed not to program loyalty, but to analyze the\nrecruit's responses to various situations—an extreme\nparameters test to see when a prospective sentinel\nwill break. Many potential members are carefully\nanalyzed by a Promethean with extreme expertise in\ncharacter judgment and personality profiling. Those\nwho don't pass such tests are killed in a manner that\nthey must resort to an earlier backup or have their\nmemories altered, so that they have no recollection of\ntheir brush with the group.\nUltimately Firewall walks a fine line. The concept\nof dogmatic \"unquestioned loyalty\" is both anathema\nto everything Firewall stands and counterproductive.\nIts sentinels need to have the capacity for thinking\noutside of the box from mission to mission. At the\nsame time, their ultimate goals are too important to\nrisk—the survival of transhumanity depends on it—\nso some extreme measures must sometimes be taken\nto ensure the organization remains intact and secure.\nNew sentinels are given a code name and fake\nidentification. Outside of the proxies, the real-world\nidentity of a given sentinel is a closely-guarded secret.\nSentinels are even discouraged from sharing such information\nwith members of their own teams, though\nthis line is often crossed. Additionally, each sentinel is\nrequired to upload a backup to Firewall's secure servers\nThis backup serves a dual purpose, enabling all\nsentinels to be retrieved should they die, but also putting\na copy of the sentinel in Firewall's hands should\nthey ever need to interrogate them.\nSentinels are all connected via the Eye, Firewall's\npeer-to-peer social network. Though each operates\nbehind their assumed identity, they remain in contact,\nsharing information and resources as needed.\nbeginquotation\n<strong>OPTIONAL RULE: I-REP</strong>\ni-Rep tracks the reputation a sentinel earns through\ntheir service to Firewall. i-Rep is used with Networking:\nFirewall skill and tracked exactly like any other\nReputation score (p. 285). The important thing to\nkeep in mind, however, is that Firewall agents come\nfrom all factions and are obligated to help each other,\nespecially when a situation demands it. To reflect this\nextra advantage, gamemasters can choose to implement\none or more of the following optional rules:\nbeginitemize\n• <strong>Networking Plus</strong>: To reflect that Firewall has\nagents throughout transhumanity, a character\nmay use any Networking skill field with their i-\nRep. Favors bought with reputation still apply\nto the i-rep score, no matter what network they\nwere acquired from.\n• <strong>Priority Call</strong>: When the chips are really down, a\nsentinel can call on favors as a priority urgency.\nThis “priority code” is reserved for favors that\nare critical to a mission’s success and which may\nhelp save lives or stop a major threat. When the\npriority code is invoked, the sentinel receives a\n+30 modifier to their Networking Test and favors\nare reduced by 2 levels. Sentinels know that priority\ncodes are only to be used for emergency\nsituations, however, when there are no other\noptions. Abuse of priority codes is considered\na serious breach of etiquette and abuse of resources,\nusually involving the agent’s removal\nfrom Firewall.\nenditemize\nendquotation\nsubsubsectionProxies \nProxies are the inner circle of Firewall, the experienced\ncadre that keeps the machinery of their organization\nfunctioning. Though fewer in number than the\nsentinels, many proxies work full time on Firewall\noperations, serving as the group's essential infrastructure\nMost proxies are recruited from the ranks of the\nsentinels, brought in based on their skill sets and aptitudes\nto fill key roles. In a few rare cases, new proxies\nare fast-tracked and recruited directly from outside\nof Firewall, usually based on their unique talents or\nplacement within a certain organization, though such\ninductees face a battery of tests and trials far harsher\nthan that used to vet sentinels.\nBy default, proxies have a higher security clearance\nthan most sentinels, and are far more in the\nknow. This sometimes leads to resentment and hostilities\nespecially from sentinels who feel they are\nbeing kept in the dark or manipulated. While standard\nproxy protocol is to adhere to a need-to-know\nmaxim, it is sometimes necessary to bring sentinels\nmore into the loop in order to defuse tensions. Oftentimes\nthis precedes bringing such sentinels into\nthe proxy framework.\nSome tension exists within Firewall, mostly due to\nthe influence of so many anarchists and other libertarian\nautonomists who take a dim view of centralized\npower, lack of transparency, and the potential for secretive\noperations to become entrenched and authoritarian\nAs a result, there is a strong internal culture\nthat seeks to minimize hierarchies and the accumulation\nof power, promoting transparency and direct\ndemocratic decision-making. These desires sometimes\nclash with the clandestine nature of the organization,\nhowever, and the need for some secrets to be kept on\na need-to-know basis.\nUnlike the loose organization of the sentinels, the\nproxies are grouped into <em>servers,</em> collective working\ngroups based upon certain skill sets and tasks. To\navoid creating power blocks within a given server,\n%%% 360\npersonnel are required to rotate between servers\nafter one year of time. This incurs the added benefit\nof proxies learning new skill sets and increasing their\nusefulness to Firewall. The actions of each server are\nkept as transparent as possible, with major decisions\nbrought to an e-vote before the entire proxy membership\nHowever, speed often requires servers or individual\nproxies to move quicker than a vote will allow.\nIn all such instances, the proxies involved are held\naccountable for those actions, reviewed by their peers\nat a later time to see if any reprimands, punishments,\nor commendations are required.\nIt is important to note that there is no core leadership\nstructure among the proxies. No one person or\ncabal is in charge, there is no authority held by one\nproxy or another; all are peers. Though reputation\nand experience play a factor, getting something done\noften means convincing other proxies that it's the\nright thing to do. The drawback to being a leader\nor person with initiative within Firewall is that this\nusually means you must follow through with such\ntasks yourself. Luckily most proxies are dedicated\nto Firewall's goals and so this DIY attitude prevails.\nDespite these safeguards, however, rumors of power\nblocks within Firewall (both within servers and\nacross the organization) exist. Many of these are\nfueled by the alliances different cliques hold with\neach other. Others, however, whisper that there is\na secret council among the proxies, working behind\nthe scenes and holding on to knowledge they aren't\nsharing with the rest.\n<strong>Crows:</strong> Crows continue the goals of Firewall's\npredecessor organizations, such as the Lifeboat Institute\nand Singularity Foundation. Many of these\nare argonauts, promoting the development and use\nof new technologies that will benefit the transhuman\ncondition and minimize risks rather than creating\nnew threats or sparking new authoritarian uses—\nand always conscious of unintended consequences.\nPerhaps more importantly, crows actively engage\nin background research of potential x-risk vectors,\nwhether those be aliens, the TITANs, terrorists, or\nhypercorp activity. Often they will deploy sentinels\nto aid in this research, via routers, whether this\nmeans conducting surveillance or breaking and entering\nto steal crucial data.\n<strong>Erasure Squads:</strong> Erasure squads are cleanup personnel\nThey are called into action if sentinels fail to\ndeal appropriately with a situation and the threat is\nmoving beyond control. If the watchword for a sentinel\nis \"unobtrusive,\" the watchwords for an erasure\nsquad are \"overmatched firepower.\" If activated, the\ntime for a subtle solution is passed, and they will use\nwhatever means necessary to resolve the situation.\nIf that means nuking a settlement from orbit to annihilate\na nanoswarm and keep it from escaping to\na larger settlement, then so be it. After which they'll\nuse every trick in Firewall's bag to erase any evidence\n%%% 361\nthey were there and to place the blame for the incident\nsquarely on the shoulders of some other party.\nIf necessary, erasure squads can also be called in to\nfix a sentinel op that has turned into a clusterfuck or\notherwise gone south. They are very careful to avoid\nexposure in such situations, however, which sometimes\nmerely means eliminating all traces of Firewall\ninvolvement and letting the sentinels take the fall for\ntheir poor choices.\n<strong>Routers:</strong> Routers are mission coordinators. They\nwork closely with scanners and crows, activating the\nappropriate sentinels whenever a new danger rears up.\nEach router has the authority to measure the threat\nand activate an appropriate number of sentinels—\nwhatever is required to accomplish the mission in\nthe least intrusive manner possible. They are also\nauthorized to divert Firewall resources to aid these\nmissions, within appropriate parameters. Routers are\nheld responsible for the ultimate success of a mission\nA failed mission will result in a reviewing board\nstaffed by their peers.\n<strong>Scanners:</strong> Tasked with keeping alert for any sign of\nnew active threats, scanners are the eyes and ears of\nFirewall. The scanners maintain a close eye on news-feeds\nand mesh traffic, even maintaining taps inside\ncertain government and hypercorp communication\nchannels. If a danger is detected, it is under their authority\nthrough routers, that sentinels are activated.\nDue to the power inherent in a scanners' post, they\nare held accountable for false activations.\n<strong>Social Engineers:</strong> Nick-named the Ministry of Disinformation\nsocial engineers provide the scapegoating\nand plausible deniability that is required by Firewall\nand its sentinels. If a sentinel compromises their position\nand endangers the organization, social engineers\nstep in to cover cracks in the facade. They work intrinsically\nwith erasure squads when one is activated\nto ensure the over-the-top steps taken to eliminate a\nthreat are well concealed and ultimately erased. The\npower wielded by social engineers can be significant,\nas it ultimately decides (usually through e-voting\nconsensus, though time does not always allow such\na luxury) what organization—political, corporate, independent\netc.—will take the blame and subsequent\nfallout for erasure squad actions.\n<strong>Vectors:</strong> Vectors are Firewall's communications security\nand digital intrusion specialists—in other words,\nhackers. In addition to defending the mesh security\nof all Firewall operations, vectors are also deployed\nto aid in crow research, scanner monitoring, and to\neliminate the trail of erasure squads. Vectors also\nassist routers in maintaining communications, command\nand control of a situation, and are sometimes\ncalled in to provide overwatch of sentinel operations,\nespecially if a particular sentinel squad lacks their\nown hacking resources. Needless to say, vectors are\nsupplied with some of the best intrusion and security\ntools transhumanity has to offer.\nbeginquotation\nbeginlarge\n<strong>CLIQUES</strong>\nendlarge\nThough Firewall proxies follow stringent guidelines\nto ensure the organization is not subverted from\nwithin or turned into a powerful organization\nunder the thumb of a few individuals with their\nown personal agendas, the nature of transhumanity\nensures that various factions and tendencies\nexist within the group. Termed cliques, these\ncircles of influence sometimes create ripples in the\npool that all Firewall personnel must eventually\ndeal with. Some of these cliques are grounded in\ntranshumanity’s existing factions, while others are\nrooted in philosophical differences regarding the\napproach Firewall should be taking. Gamemasters\ncan use these cliques to flesh out internal tensions\nwithin Firewall or to simply throw some curve balls\nto keep players on their toes.\n<strong>Backups</strong>: The backup clique believes that transhumanity’s\nbest chance for survival is to\ndeploy numerous redundant backup measures\nas soon as possible. These include creating as\nmany extrasolar colonies as possible, both via\nPandora Gates and through more traditional\nmeans, such as ark ships and infomorph/nanofabricator\nseed ships.\n<strong>Conservatives</strong>: This clique takes an overcautious,\nnuke-it-from-orbit approach to most\nx-risks. They believed excessive force is justifi\ned, and it’s far better to be safe than extinct.\nThis clique is also opposed to the use of alien/\nTITAN artifacts and psi, and tends to be xenophobic/\nisolationist regarding the Factors and\nPandora Gates.\n<strong>Mavericks</strong>: The mavericks disdain Firewall’s collective\nand bureaucratic tendencies, taking a\nmore individualistic approach to their work.\nThey are known to sometimes circumvent\nFirewall procedures, taking risks and allocating\nresources without approval from other\nproxies.\n<strong>Pragmatists</strong>: The pragmatists believe in using\nany and all tools at their disposal to counter\nexistential risks. They are in favor of using\nxeno-artifacts, asyncs, and anything else that\nwill save transhumanity.\n<strong>Structuralists</strong>: This clique advocates for a stronger\nstructure and centralized authority within\nFirewall, countering the group’s autonomistdominated\ntendencies. Many also advocate\nfor going legitimate, taking Firewall into\nthe public eye and making above-board connections\nwith other official organizations,\narguing that this could bring more resources\nto Firewall’s disposal.\nendquotation\n%%%% 362"

        "html": "Unobtrusive—that is the standard operating procedure\nfor any sentinel. Firewall's continued success\nrelies on its secrecy. The larger the footprint\nit leaves during a given mission the easier it is for\nother organizations to monitor Firewall's efforts or\neven attempt to infiltrate the group. As such, Firewall\nconstantly works to expand its base of allies\n(using assets from those ally organizations in place\nof its own as much as possible), place long-term\nmoles, conduct remote operations (hacking in place\nof on-site personnel), small group infiltrations activating\nonly as many sentinels as required to achieve\nmission goals), and so on.\nWhen it comes to allies, Firewall often obfuscates\nits real intentions and even its real identity. Often\nsuch allies are gained through the use of well-placed\nsentinels who act on behalf of their own non-Firewall\npositions to gain access to another organization's\nresources. At the end of the day, however,\na slice of these resources are secretly set aside for\nFirewall's future use. For example, a department\nhead at Starware may have spent years sealing a\ndeal to ship crucial spacecraft parts to the isolationist\nJovian Junta. The lucrative deal brings huge\nprestige, a job promotion, and a salary increase, all\naccomplishments the department head strives for in\nhis regular life. Yet this particular department head\nis a long-standing sentinel, so such accomplishments\nbring allies to Firewall, whether they know\nit or not. Not only can the department head siphon\noff a thin stream of revenue for Firewall use (hidden\nthoroughly by vectors), but he's also in a position\nto move sentinels, as needed, into the Jovian Junta\nhabitats (or personnel out), a job usually extremely\ndifficult to accomplish. The danger of such an act,\nof course—and the consequences of losing such a\ncritically placed sentinel—means such a use of resources\nis reserved for only the most dire threats.\nIn additional to aid from ally organizations, Firewall\nplaces caches of supplies on different habitats\nand worlds, available to sentinels as needed. How\nmany and which sentinels are aware of which\ncaches depends wholly on the situation and on the\ndecisions of the router(s) involved. In a given habitat\na cache may include weaponry and equipment\nof escalating power, archived information, or even\nrelics stashed from previous missions until Firewall\ndecides what to do with them. Large habitats may\neven feature several caches, with routers only revealing\nthe ones with heavy firepower when absolutely\nneeded. Some caches may be so dangerous,\nhowever, that once a mission is complete, a router\nwill authorize the cortical stack destruction of all\nsentinels involved, resleeving them to a backup that\nhas no knowledge of the cache's existence.\nAs noted under erasure squads, Firewall will not\nhesitate to react with swift and unequivocal force if\nan unobtrusive approach has failed and the danger\nreaches a certain threat level. What constitutes a\n\"threat threshold\" is actually calculated by specialized\nrisk assessment software and may change from\nmission to mission according to other external factors\nIn some instances, if the situation is dangerous\nenough and the scale of the consequences of failure\nlarge enough, a Promethean will be tapped to calculate\nthe threat level and decide when it is time to\ntactically withdrawal and \"thermally cleanse.\"\nbeginquotation\nbeginlarge\n<strong>WHAT HELP CAN A SENTINEL EXPECT?</strong>\nendlarge\nExactly what help Firewall provides to a sentinel\nduring a mission is wholly dependent upon\nthe situation and the gamemaster. Generally\nspeaking, Firewall’s unobtrusive approach also\napplies to activated sentinels, meaning that\nsentinels are largely left to operate on their\nown accord. Beyond access to a cache of supplies—\nusually under-stated, forcing a sentinel\nto use their own resources if they want more—\nFirewall expects its sentinels to be capable of\nhandling a situation. In addition to their skills\nand wits, sentinels can, of course, rely heavily\non their i-rep to gain the resources and favors\nthey need to achieve success.\nIn some rare cases, the gamemaster may\ndecide that a situation warrants more or less\nequipment in a cache or help from social engineers\nor vectors. Such intervention should be\nkept to a minimum, however, to lesson the\nplayers’ feelings of Deus Ex Machina, ensuring\nthe appropriate response of awe when such\nevents do occur.\nThe one thing for which Firewall can always\nbe relied on is backup insurance. Any Firewall\nkilled in the line of duty will be resleeved at\nFirewall’s expense—though the morph used\nand whether the sentinel was backed up from\ntheir cortical stack or a backup (perhaps even\nan old backup) depends entirely on the circumstances\nof death and their router’s whim. Firewall\nusually makes an extra effort to retrieve\ncortical stacks, however, not in the least as they\ndon’t want their agents’ backups falling into\nthe wrong hands.\nSimilarly, if a Firewall mission involves egocasting\nor travel to another destination, Firewall\nwill usually foot the bill. In many cases\nit is easier for sentinels to cover the expense\nthemselves and bill Firewall later, but in times\nof need Firewall can be called on to handle\nsuch expenses directly.\nendquotation\n%%% 363"

        "title": "Basilisk Hacks",
        "html": "Thanks to the vast databanks of knowledge the TITANs\nhad absorbed from transhumanity, the Exsurgent virus\nwas able to thoroughly analyze the biology and functioning\nof transhuman minds. In a few short months, by\naccessing all of the research at their disposal, the Exsurgent\nand TITAN minds made several cognitive leaps in\ntheir understanding of transhuman brain functions—\nbreakthroughs that will take transhumanity decades to\nreach. One of these discoveries was a method of applying\nsensory input as a weapon, exploiting weaknesses\nin the brain's neuro-cerebral wiring.\nKnown as \"basilisk hacks,\" these attacks take\nadvantage of the way biological transhuman brains\ninterpret and process sensory input in the cerebral\ncortex. Just as epileptics are susceptible to visualizations\nthat strobe at certain frequencies, basilisk hacks\nemploy special visual and auditory patterns that trigger\nglitches in the brain's neuronal wiring to inflict\n%%% 367\nnausea, vertigo, disorientation, and even seizures,\noften mistaken as a stroke or cerebrovascular incident.\nSome basilisk hacks go farther than simply causing\nthe brain to seize up and crash, however, enabling a\nmechanism to rewrite the neural code in victims who\nview or listen to the wrong thing. This unknown reprogramming\nmechanism enables the virus to infect\neven a biological brain with one of its strains. Similar\nattacks are used against both synthmorphs and pods,\ntaking advantage of the methods in which cyberbrains\nmimic biological minds with a virtual brain state, and\nthus also manipulating them via the information encoded\nin sensory input.\nIn a nutshell, basilisk hacks are a way of hacking\ntranshuman brains merely by feeding them a specific\nsample of sensory input, usually images or sounds.\nThe widespread use of augmented reality makes\ndeployment of such hacks an easy manner; the Exsurgent\nvirus just hacks into the target's ecto or mesh\ninserts and engages the sensory feed. More traditional\nmethods may also be used, including standard interactive\nvideo, holograms, audio, subsonics, or even VR.\nSince so many records of the years surrounding\nthe Fall were lost, most people do not know if the\nbasilisk hack is anything other than a legend. Various\nofficial groups know that this technology was, in fact,\nused by the TITANs, but they keep this knowledge to\nthemselves, in large part to help reduce the number of\npeople attempting to duplicate it.\nsubsubsectionIncapacitating Inputs\nWhen a character experiences a basilisk hack, they\nmust make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this test\nfails, their brain is susceptible to the hack, and they\nimmediately suffer 1d10 mental stress. Additionally,\none of the following effects applies. The duration for\neach effect listed below is 1 minute plus 1 additional\nminute per 10 full points of MoF. Each effect is also\nnumbered 1–10, in case the gamemaster wants to roll\n1d10 and randomize the effects rather than choose:\nbeginitemize\n• <strong>(1) Cataplexy: </strong>The victim loses control of their\nbody and immediately collapses. For the duration\ntheir body will be non-responsive but they will\nbe aware and capable of mental actions. Mesh\nactions and implant controls are also disabled,\nhowever.\n• <strong>(2) Catatonic Stupor:</strong> The character becomes\nimmobile and non-responsive. Though conscious,\nthey are mentally \"not there\"—the basilisk hack\nhas effectively crashed their brain functions. They\nwill do absolutely nothing for the duration and\nwill not respond even if moved or attacked.\n• <strong>(3) Disorientation:</strong> The character becomes disoriented and severely confused. They are incapable\nof making decisions, understanding communication, understanding what is going on around\nthem, or acting in any sort of determined way for\nthe duration.\n• <strong>(4–5) Grand Mal Seizures:</strong> The subject immediately\nfalls to the ground and begins convulsing,\nsuffering 1d10 damage. They may do nothing\nelse for the duration and will suffer an equal\nduration period of confusion and weakness (–30\nto all actions) afterwards.\n• <strong>(6–7) Hallucinations:</strong> The character immediately\ngoes off on a mental trip, leaving them completely\ndisconnected from reality and their physical body.\nFor the duration, the character should only respond\nto the hallucinated reality the gamemaster\ndescribes to them, or else the character should be\ntreated as an NPC, run by the gamemaster.\n• <strong>(8) Impaired Cognition:</strong> The character's mental\ncapabilities bottom out, turning them into a\ndisabled vegetable. COG, INT, SAV, and WIL all\ndrop to 1, and the character should act accordingly\nto environmental stimuli.\n• <strong>(9) Nausea/Vertigo:</strong> The character is overcome\nwith head-spinning and vomiting and is effectively\nincapacitated for the duration.\n• <strong>(10) Sleep:</strong> The character passes out for the\nduration and cannot be woken short of medical\nintervention.\nIn rare cases, a character may be able to \"dodge\"\na basilisk hack they know is coming, assuming they\nhave some sort of warning (such as their buddy falling\nprey to it moments before). The character must of\ncourse be aware of what basilisk hacks are to even\nconsider this idea. If they immediately attempt to take\naction to block out the sensory input when it strikes—\nclosing their eyes, plugging their ears, turning off their\nAR, etc.—allow them a REF x 3 Test to see if they do\nso in time.\nenditemize\nsubsubsectionSensory Reprogramming\nIn some cases, the Exsurgent virus can actually reprogram\nthe target's mind via dedicated sensory input.\nThis is a trickier affair, however, requiring uninterrupted\nprogramming time. As with incapacitating inputs,\nthe target character(s) experiencing the basilisk hack\nmust make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this fails, they\nbecome catatonic and paralyzed for a period of 10\nminutes, minus 1 minute per 10 full points of MoF. At\nthe end of this period, they are mentally reprogrammed\nand \"infected\" with one of the strains of the Exsurgent\nvirus (see below). For the duration of this period, the\ncharacter is undergoing reprogramming as long as they\nremain exposed to the basilisk hack. If the character is\nsomehow cut off through the actions of another party,\nthe reprogramming immediately fails. In this case,\nhowever, the victim still suffers 1d10 mental stress\n+ 1 per minute they were exposed, and they remain\nmentally shaken, suffering a –30 modifier to all actions.\nThis modifier reduces at the rate of 10 per minute.\nsubsubsectionYGBM Attacks \nRather than completely reprogramming a victim, some\nExsurgent attacks simply intend to plant subconscious\n%%% 368\ncommands in the target's mind, similar to posthypnotic\nsuggestions. Nicknamed \"You gotta believe me\"\nattacks, YGBMs are a sort of remote digital brainwashing\nattempt used to create sleeper terrorists and\nunknowing collaborators, often by targeting them via\nthe mesh. Unlike the mind manipulation techniques\nof psychosurgery (p. 229), YGBM attacks use shotgun\ntechniques to open the mind, utilizing some kind of\nbackdoor the Exsurgents discovered in the transhuman\nbrain, and altering the mind by brute force.\nA character experiencing a YGBM basilisk hack\nmust make a COG + INT + SAV Test. If this fails, a\nsingle suggestion is implanted in the character's mind,\nwithout their knowledge. This subliminal command\nwill be triggered at some later point, either at some\npredesignated time or according to certain pre-set\nconditions. Once triggered, the character will carry\nout the action with all of the conviction that it is their\nown idea. The implanted suggestion may be something\nas simple as \"kill the Firewall agent\" to something as\ncomplex as ``manufacture an explosive device and\nplant it in the cargo hold of any ship heading to Mars,\nset to explode one day after they disembark.''\nSince YGBM attacks are not intended to completely\nconvert the target, but instead to simply convert them\ninto a temporary tool or weapon, implanted commands\nare not designed to last long. The duration\nthe suggestion will last equals 3 days +1 day per 10\npoints of MoF on the resistance test. If the command\nhas not been triggered by this point, it dissipates, and\nthe character is none the wiser.\nsubsubsectionRecording Basilisk Hacks\nEnterprising characters may seek to record a basilisk\nhack input for their own uses. While basilisk hacks may\nbe recorded like any other sensory input, keep in mind\nthat the Exsurgents and TITANs likely take measures\nto keep such tools out of the hands of transhumanity,\nlest they construct some sort of defense. Basilisk hack\nsources may be self-erasing or contain coding or countermeasures\nthat would hinder recording, such as white\nnoise to defeat audio recording or lens-blinding flashes\nto defeat video recording. Conversely, basilisk hacks are\nconsidered extremely dangerous by almost all factions\nof transhumanity and universally feared. An individual\nor group known to possess them is likely to be treated\nmuch like a terrorist with a suitcase nuke. Though\nFirewall has a standard interest in evaluating and enabling\nsome sort of defense against basilisk hacks, most\nFirewall personnel consider it foolish to handle such\ntoys and would rather destroy such recordings outright."

        "title": "Exsurgent Strains",
        "html": "Four variants of the Exsurgent virus are described\nhere—gamemasters are encouraged to develop their\nown to keep players on their toes.\nsubsubsectionHaunting Virus\nThis strain is the most insidious of the Exsurgent virii.\nOver time, it rewrites the target's personality and\nmotivations, slowly but surely subverting and taking\ncontrol of the victim's mind. At first the character is\nunlikely to even be aware of the infection, and as it\nprogresses the changes the virus makes to the target\nwill at first seem natural to the target, as if some new\naspect of their personality was simply manifesting\nitself. As the effects grow more pronounced, however,\nthe victim becomes aware that they are being methodically\naltered but is in most cases unable to act against\nit. In the end, they are completely transformed into a\npawn of the ETI. Their mind is no longer transhuman,\nbut <em>alien.</em>\nThe exact rate of progression is up to the gamemaster\nthough guidelines are provided below. Each victim\nis affected differently, so the process may be accelerated\nor slowed down as the gamemaster sees fit.\n%%% 369\nbeginitemize\n• <strong>Stage 1 (initial infection to 3 months):</strong> Upon initial\ninfection, the character suffers 1d10 mental\nstress and gains the Psi trait (p. 147) at Level 1\n(also meaning they pick up the Mental Disorder\ntrait, as noted on p. 150). They also gain one free\npsi-chi sleight, chosen randomly or by the gamemaster\nIf a player character has become infected,\nthey may still be played as normal (see <em>Roleplay-</em>\n<em>ing Exsurgents,</em> p. 368), and may purchase new\npsi-chi sleights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1\nnew sleight per 2–4 weeks.\nAt this stage, the infection is usually hidden,\nthough the character will suffer from occasional\nhaunting effects (see below). As each week passes,\nthe character's personality should shift a minute\namount, slowly becoming more callous and conniving\nand changing in other ways as well. If\npossible, the player should be kept in the dark\nabout what is happening, but the gamemaster\nshould provide them with roleplaying advice to\nreflect their condition. Likewise, the discovery\nand initial use of psi sleights should be played\nout, providing some interesting roleplaying opportunities\nCharacters and players who know of\nthe Exsurgent virus and Watts-Macleod strains\nshould not know at this point which strain they\nare infected with—make them sweat.\n• <strong>Stage 2 (3 months to 6 months):</strong> The target suffers\nanother 1d10 <em>div</em> 2 (round up) mental stress\nand acquires the Psi trait at Level 2 (also picking\nup another disorder). Player characters may\nstill be played as normal and may purchase psi-gamma\nslights with Rez Points. NPCs acquire 1\nnew sleight per 2–4 weeks.\nOnce three months have passed, the character\nshould be aware they are under the influence\nof something, but this awareness likely comes\ntoo late. Haunting effects (below) should occur\nregularly. At this point a character is likely to\nconsider offing themselves and resorting to an\nuninfected backup, seeking help, or actively encouraging\nothers to interfere. The infection will\nactively block and hinder such thoughts and actions\nhowever. To actively overcome this mental\ncontrol, the character must succeed in a WIL Test.\nAt the gamemaster's discretion, failure may result\nin 1d10 <em>div</em> 2 (round up) mental stress as the character\nrealizes they are no longer fully in control\nof their own thoughts and actions.\n• <strong>Stage 3 (6 months+):</strong> The victim suffers another\n1d10 <em>div</em> 2 (round up) mental stress and acquires\nthe Psi trait at Level 3 (see below). The character\nis now considered an exsurgent and becomes\nan NPC. It may no longer be played as a player\ncharacter. The victim also gains a permanent\n+5 bonus to COG and WIL and acquires 1 new\nsleight every 1–2 months.\nenditemize\nAs noted above, characters infected with this strain\nsuffer from different haunting effects—changes\nto their personality or mind-state. A few ideas for\nhaunting effects are noted here, but gamemasters are\nencouraged to be creative when inventing their own\nto apply:\nbeginitemize\n• <strong>Altered Perceptions:</strong> The victim's perceptions are\nchanged in disturbing and unusual ways. They\nmay see things that aren't there, feel a presence\nbehind or watching them, inexplicably smell\nblood, hear voices, suffer synaesthesia, or suddenly\nperceive the people around them as nothing\nbut outlandish, blabbering sacks of meat.\n• <strong>Behavioral Modification:</strong> Treat as behavioral control\nor personality editing psychosurgery (p. 231).\nThis is typically applied to shape the character\ncloser to being a pawn of the ETI.\n• <strong>Dream Manipulation:</strong> The character's dreams\nbecome lucid, weird, and surreal. They may find\nthemselves dreaming of life as an alien on some\nexotic exoplanet, as a robotic probe soaring\nthrough the vast emptiness of space, or fantasizing\ndifferent methods of inflicting mass destruction\nand death.\n• <strong>Emotional Manipulation:</strong> Treat as emotional\ncontrol psychosurgery (p. 231).\n• <strong>Inexplicable Urges:</strong> The character will be flushed\nwith strange alien urges and may sometimes find\nthemselves doing highly unusual things without\nrealizing at all they are doing it. These may include\ntaking devices apart to understand how\nthey work, testing the limits on programming a\nnanofabricator, cutting a living thing apart to see\nhow it is put together biologically, testing weapons\neating things that are only barely edible, promiscuous\nand unusual sexual activity, lying just\nto see what they can get away with, and so on.\nenditemize\nsubsubsectionMindstealer Virus\nVery similar to the haunting virus, the mindstealer\nstrain is much quicker acting. Instead of slowly subverting\nthe target's mind over the course of months,\nthe mindstealer virus rapidly recodes the victim's brain\nin a matter of minutes. This infection is much more\ninvasive and brute-force, often causing significant\nside effects to the target's mental state as a result. This\nstrain is only spread as a digital virus, nanoplague, or\nbasilisk hack (not as a biological nanovirus).\nOnce the victim is infected, it takes the virus a\nnumber of Action Turns equal to COG + INT + SAV\nto completely take over their mind (20 Action Turns\n= 1 minute). During this time, the target is actively\naware that their mind is under attack and undergoing\nmassive changes against their will. This process\nis confusing, frightening, and painful, inflicting  a\n–30 modifier to all of the character's actions for the\nduration. Many victims are reduced to whimpering,\ndrooling, or convulsing for the duration.\nThis mental transformation inflicts 2d10 mental\nstress to the target. Once complete, the victim is an\nexsurgent NPC, under the gamemaster's control.\n%%% 370\nsubsubsectionWatts-Macleod Virus\nThe Watts-Macleod strain is a strangely benevolent\nversion of the Exsurgent virus, seeming to imbue its\nvictims with psi abilities without any of the other\ntransformative elements typical of other strains.\nPerhaps created as an accidental mutation of the Exsurgent\nvirus, there are many who wonder if the true\ndetrimental effects of this strain simply have yet to\nreveal themselves.\nAs noted in the <em>Mind Hacks</em> chapter section on Psi\n(p. 220), characters infected with this strain gain the\nPsi trait (p. 147) at either Level 1 or 2. If a character\nis so infected during game play, this trait must be\npurchased with Rez Points (if the character does not\nhave any points currently available, they pay out of\nthe points they earn until the debt is paid off). All of\nthe other side effects of Watts-Macleod infection (p.\n367) also apply.\nThough infection with this strain does apply some\nbenefits to the character, the gamemaster should make\nsure to play up the creepy and unsettling nature of\nthis virus. The character should never be certain that\nthey haven't in fact been subtly influenced by the virus\nin ways they can't immediately pinpoint—they should\nalways feel like the ax may fall at any moment.\nsubsubsectionXenomorph Virus\nThe xenomorph strain transforms the target's body\nin addition to their mind. Over time, the victims\nmorph physically transmogrifies into some sort\nof alien life form. It is only spread as a biological\nnanovirus or nanoplague (not as a digital virus or\nbasilisk hack). Different variants of this strain produce\ndifferent alien forms. It is not known where\nthese different alien templates originated, meaning\nthey may be copies of (once) existing alien species\nor simply neogenetic creatures created from scratch.\nThe one trait they have in common is that they are\nuniversally dangerous. Some speculation in Firewall\ncircles suggests that the Exsurgent virus may in fact\nhave a \"library\" of creature types to deploy, under\nthe assumption that at least some will be more effective\nthan others for exterminating whatever victim\nspecies they are fielded against.\nThis strain follows the same rules as the haunting\nvirus (above), but with the following changes. The\ntimeframe is typically much quicker, though the gamemaster\nmay adjust this as they see fit.\n<strong>Stage 1:</strong> The effects from Stage 1 of the haunting\nvirus apply. Additionally, the character begins to suffer\nminor physical changes that are definitely unusual but\nare not impeding in any way and are easily hidden\nfrom others. Example biomorph alterations might be:\nunusual hair or fibrous growth, some skin discoloration\nor translucence, severe rashes, dermal thickening\nweakened or enhanced sensory organs, strong\nbody odor, hair loss, teeth gain or loss, vestigial tail or\nother limb growth, minor dietary changes, and so on.\nSynthmorphs might experience minor system glitches,\nmalfunctioning or improved components, and spots\nof material stress or transfiguration.  Gamemasters\nare encouraged to be creative. This stage typically\nlasts from initial infection to 1 week for biological\nnanovirus strains, or from infection to just 1 hour for\nnanoplague strains.\n<strong>Stage 2:</strong> As with haunting virus Stage 2, plus the\ncharacter begins to seriously transmogrify in ways\nthat are difficult to hide from others, becoming\nmore and more monstrous as the stage progresses.\nExample biomorph transformations include: growing\nscales or feathers, partial modification of limb\nstructure, partial new limb growth, vestigial sensory\norgan growth, sensory loss, extension of claws or\nspines, severe dietary changes, etc. Synthmorphs\nmight experience radical system and shape alterations\nlimited or enhanced sensor functions, or even\nconversion of their robotic shell to smart materials.\nThese physical changes weaken the victim, inflicting\n1d10 physical damage. This stage typically lasts 1\nweek for biological nanovirus strains or just 1 hour\nfor nanoplague strains.\n<strong>Stage 3:</strong> As with haunting virus Stage 3, a character\nreaching this stage becomes an NPC. Additionally,\nthe victim completely undergoes a transformation\ninto some sort of creature that is no longer even remotely\nhuman. Example exsurgents of this nature are\ndetailed on p. 369."

        "title": "Using The Exsurgent Virus",
        "html": "The frightening thing about the Exsurgent virus is\nits adaptability. It was written by a near omnipotent\nETI with the intent of corrupting any alien seed AIs\nor similar singularities it encountered, and it is <em>very</em>\ngood at it. This means it has the capability to analyze\nunderstand, and mimic almost any alien digital\nprotocols and communication methods it comes into\ncontact with, no matter how diverse the alien mindset\nthat constructed what it encounters. It then has a cunning\nability to circumvent any safeguards and infect\nsuch systems. From there, it rapidly assimilates any\ndata it can about the target species/civilization and\ndoes it best to mutate into other forms that can attack\nthis target from other vectors.\nGiven its constant morphing nature then, the Exsurgent\nvirus is likely to continue to mutate in new\nand interesting ways. Some of these mutations may\nbe effective, many not. This does, however, afford the\ngamemaster an opportunity to invent new variants of\ntheir own to deploy against unsuspecting characters."

        "title": "Roleplaying Exsurgents",
        "html": "The primary thing for gamemasters to keep in mind\nwhen roleplaying entities that have been taken over\nby the Exsurgent virus is that exsurgents are following\nan alien agenda. The specific goals and actions of\neach exsurgent may differ, but they are generally concerned\nwith two things: spreading the Exsurgent virus\nand destroying anything that isn't affected. In some\ncases, this may mean immediate and enraged hostile\naction against anything non-exsurgent around them.\n%%% 371\nIn others, the exsurgent approach is more methodical\nhatching long-term plots to infiltrate positions of\npower and authority, setting the stage for acts of mass\ndestruction, and so on. In other words, they may be\nhandled both as hostile monsters or as nefarious long-term\nopponents that are subverting transhumanity\nfrom within or hatching complicated plots that could\nmean devastation on a planetary scale.\nIf the gamemaster wishes, exsurgents may also\npursue other goals, tangential to the ones above.\nThese may range from accumulating knowledge and\nexpertise on how transhumanity functions as a species\nto forcibly uploading mass numbers of minds to\nmore esoteric goals such as manufacturing a halfnium\nbomb or converting the solar system's mass to computronium\nThe Exsurgent virus is potent and intelligent,\nand while its methods and goals may sometimes be\nopaque to transhumanity, it acts with direction and\npurpose. There may also be occasions, however, likely\ndue to the mutating and morphing aspect of the virus\nand the way in which it transforms transhuman\nminds, perhaps not always in the manner intended,\nwhere the exsurgent goals become strange or simply\nhorrific, such as running experiments on transhuman\nresponses to extreme conditions or converting an\nentire colony to cannibalism.\nsubsubsectionExsurgent-Infected PCs\nIt is possible for player characters infected with some\nstrains of the Exsurgent virus to continue on under\ntheir own volition, even as the virus slowly consumes\nthem. This process is, quite naturally, horrifying in the\nextreme, though there is little they can do about it.\nDespite the best efforts of transhuman science, there\nis very little that can be done to save an infected\nperson—the virus is simply too potent and adaptive.\nAs a result, standard Firewall policy is to terminate\nthe infected with extreme prejudice. Most Firewall\noperatives are going to be aware of this, a fact which\npushes some of those who become infected to keep\ntheir status a secret from their comrades.\nBoth the haunting and xenomorph strains usually\ntransform a subject over time, meaning that the\ncharacter may initially not be aware of the infection.\nThis is a prime opportunity for the gamemaster to\nmess with the character ruthlessly, starting slowly\nwith little haunting effects and building up as the\ninfection progresses. The character should slowly\nbecome aware that they are under the influence of\nsomething—something <em>intelligent.</em> Characters aware\nof the Exsurgent virus and its effects will likely pick\nup on this sooner, but the virus may prevent them\nfrom doing anything about it. In effect, the character\nbecomes a prisoner within their own body, a body\nthey now share with a cold and malevolent presence\nthat is methodically taking them over. Such\ncharacters may respond in a number of ways depending\non their personality, ranging from despair,\nwithdrawal, and suicidal tendencies to complete\nhysteria or calm acceptance. Most importantly,\nhowever, their personality should begin to change\nas the virus continues to transform them. Players\nshould be encouraged to take on new demeanors\nand motivations, reflecting the alien component\nof their changing personality, with some guidance\nfrom the gamemaster. This presents some intriguing\nroleplaying opportunities that the players will\nhopefully embrace. If the gamemaster feels that the\nplayer is not adequately representing the changing\nmindset, however, the transformation can simply\nbe accelerated and the character converted into a\ngamemaster-operated NPC."

Repeated inquiries\nby transhuman mediators have been simply ignored or\nanswered in cryptic terms that have yet to be deciphered.\nThe Factor home world is in fact an Earth-like\nplanet with comparable atmospheric conditions and\na prevalent hydrosphere but with longer periods of\ndarkness (due to slower rotation of the planet and a\nless-luminous orange giant). While adapted transhumans\ncould find their planet habitable, their abiogenesis\n(the formation of life from self-replicating, but\nnot-living molecules) took a different route than life\non Earth.\nThe Factors' primordial ancestors began in their\nplanet's early geological history as a type of of photosynthesizer\nthat ate carbon dioxide and water and\nreleased oxygen, also obtaining energy from inorganic\nchemicals like hydrogen sulfide. Long conditions\nwithout direct light on their homeworld, however,\nspurred the success of organisms that could survive\nby acquiring energy in other ways.

Though they\n\"stand\" only 0.3 meters tall, their body diameter\nranges from 1.5 to 2 meters, they can be up to 2\nmeters long, and they can shape their body to change\nthese dimensions. Instead of walking, they crawl or\nooze from place to place by protruding finger-like\nstructures (so called <em>pseudopodia</em>) that attach to the\nground (or wall or ceiling) and which they use to pull\nand retract their rear forward (similar to cell migration\nDue to their malleable shape they are not as\nstrongly affected by gravity as transhumans.\nMost Factors that have been encountered are dull\nocher in color and are made from a gooey, gel-like\nsubstance of unknown composition, though yellow\nglistening patches (which are temporary organelles)\nand bundles of fibers (some kind of muscular skeleton\noften become visible when they move. While\nall Factors are able to express versatile pseudopodia\nto manipulate and operate devices (and even attack),\nsome subspecies possess, carry, or are able to develop\nadditional differentiated limbs, cilia, or organs with\nspecialized functions.\nsubsubsectionFactor Colonies\nUnlike transhumans, Factors rarely act individually—\nin fact, individuality is a concept somewhat foreign\nto Factors. Most Factors join together into a collective\nunit termed a <em>colony.</em> A typical Factor colony is\ncomposed of hundreds or thousands of individual\nFactors that literally physically join together into a\nmass organism (resembling more a primordial soup\nthan a gargantuan Factor). Individual Factors are\nindistinguishable from each other when merged into\nthe supra-structure of the colony, though individuals\ncan form and break apart to accomplish different\ntasks. This colonial merging is mainly possible due\nto the fact that Factors don't possess differentiated\nand specialized organs or cell types that need to be\nsegregated from each other, but instead use an open\nsystem of local, temporary gradients for regulation.\n%%% 376\nNeurofilament connections effectively allow the\nFactor colony to operate with a group mind-state,\nwith supercomputer potential. This also allows for the\neasy transfer of knowledge and memories to all other\nfactors within a colony.\nIf dismembered, blown apart, or otherwise separated\nindividual Factors in a colony can regenerate\nand reconstitute at a rapid rate without loss of ability\nor memory.\nFactors reproduce when different members of the\ncolony produce gametes that fuse, grow into spore\nstalks, and emit spores that later hatch and grow clones.\nsubsubsectionBiodiversity And Self-Design \nFactors colonies are known for their high biodiversity,\nfeaturing numerous sub-groups (so called <em>phenotypes</em>)\nthat each have unique traits (cilia, apocrine glands, carapace-like\nouter membrane) that give them an ecological\nadvantage or a utilitarian aptitude for certain tasks.\nThese traits are not random evolutionary features, but\nare the result of intentional bio-engineering. The Factors\nhave a strong grip on their own metabolisms and\ngenetic expressions and can draw on an array of genetic\nbuilding blocks and biotech techniques to modify\nthemselves rapidly and massively to adapt to special\nconditions. Whether these modifications might have a\npurpose beyond function, such as for reproduction or\nself-expression, is currently unknown.\nsubsubsectionMetabolism \nFactors ships and habitats have transhuman-friendly\natmospheres with a slightly higher content of carbon\ndioxide and less nitrogen that mimics the conditions\non the Factors' home planet. They don't breathe\noxygen via lungs but absorb it via their outer \"skin.\"\nSince they can also use oxygen from other sources\n(minerals, liquids like water, and salts) to fuel their\naerobic energy production (i.e., respiration), they can\nbe considered functional anaerobes, meaning they can\nsurvive in environments without atmosphere, though\nthey must usually supply themselves with food in\norder to do so.\nDuring the few ceremonial festivities to which\nFactors were invited and actually attended, they\nconsumed and processed transhuman organic food\nby internalization. On the first occasion, dishes and\ndinnerware were absorbed as well due to misunderstanding\nbut were excreted unharmed after the organic\ncomponents the factors could utilize had been\nbroken down.\nWhile Factors are omnivores similar to transhumans,\nthey prefer immobilized live prey, which they enjoy\nabsorbing internally and digesting, excreting those\nparts that cannot be used to fuel their metabolism.\nAs such they can devour biomorphs and non-metallic\ncomponents of synthmorphs.\nsubsubsectionPerception \nFactors don't perceive the world as transhumans\ndo. They (usually) don't possess visual or acoustic\norgans to see or hear but have a number of sensory\norgans that grant them a 360-degree awareness of\ntheir surroundings and enable them to interact\nwith their environment similar to or in some cases\neven better than transhumans do. Their perception\nspectra includes the infrared part of the electromagnetic\nspectrum, magnetoception, a high resolution\nchemical-gradient based \"sight,\" and keen haptic\nperceptions (including vibrations).\nsubsubsectionCommunication \nDue to the lack of a vocal system, Factors use different\nmethods of signaling and communication. Factors in\nphysical contact exchange information by juxtacrine\ncellular, neurofilament interfacing, or by merging for\ninformation transfer. Over distance, Factors signal via\npheromonal communication using airborne scents or\nchemical signals with different metabolic components.\nNicknamed \"Factor dust,\" this communication is effective\neven over great distances (up to 10 kilometers).\nFactor dust does have an odor perceptible to transhumans\nhowever, that ranges from smelly to unbearable.\nThis dust is also toxic in high concentrations and sometimes\nused as an offensive or defensive mechanism.\nTo date, transhumans have failed to develop a device\nthat can analyze the Factors' chemical effluvia and\ntranslate it into something understandable, due to the\nlack of a conceptual matrix (though certain \"moods\"\nhave been identified). Instead, all communication\nbetween the Factors and transhumanity is mediated\nthrough computer interfaces. Certain Factor phenotypes\nthat deal with transhumanity have grown a a\nneurobiological interface (or organ) that enables them\nto wirelessly mesh with transhuman computer systems.\nLong distance communication between Factors\nand transhumanity is achieved by normal means of\nfarcasting communication. There are strong indications\nthat Factors also take advantage of quantum-entanglement\ncommunications as well, enabling\nFactor colonies and ships to share knowledge gained\nin different parts of the galaxy."

They also enjoy\nan understanding of basic ideas of philosophy such as\naesthetics and metaphysics, though their conception of\nsuch topics is likely to differ from transhuman notions.\nsubsubsectionArt And Culture \nDue to their perceptual array, Factor \"art\" (creations\nand expressions that are appealing or attractive to\ntheir senses) is mostly chemical or tactile-based.

Since they like and are susceptible to delicate\ncompositions of different chemicals, certain bouquets\nand fragrances from liquids or volatiles such as wines\nand perfumes are both appealing and repulsive to\nFactors. The same is also true for the natural smells\nof biomorphs, meaning that Factors may respond in\na more friendly or hostile manner depending on a\nparticular transhuman's scent.\nFactors do not comprehend most transhuman art,\nas it is mostly visual or auditory based (e.g., music,\npainting), though they do seem to have an appreciation\nfor engineering, architecture, and some sculpture.\nWhile they have expressed interest in digitalized media\nout of a curiosity (or plan) to understand transhuman\nmindsets, they lack the organs and mental structure to\naccess and comprehend it.\nsubsubsectionTechnology\nThough the Factors repeatedly express dismay at\ntranshumanity's low level of technology, they have\nfailed so far to produce technology that is exceptionally\nfar in advance. Some believe that the Factors are\nsimply hiding their advanced technology in order to\nkeep transhumans from stealing or copying it, while\nothers believe this may simply be a posture taken\nby the Factors to facilitate bargaining. The Factors\nalso claim that their technology would not interest\ntranshumans because of their differences in physiology\nand mindset, and what little technology they\nhave displayed is certainly specialized for Factor use\n(specialized neurofilament links, chemical signaling\nand Factor dust interfaces, etc.) and so unusable to\nmost transhumans. The Factors have traded some\ntechnology to transhumans, at expensive cost, though\nthe small sampling provided so far seems to have\noriginated from alien species with physiologies more\nakin to transhumans.\nIt is interesting to note that scans of Factor ships\nindicate their technology level, aside from the drives,\nis not all that more advanced than transhumanity.\nAlso of note is that no two Factor ships have been\nalike, spurring some to believe that the Factors are\nin fact making use of ships acquired from other alien\nspecies—perhaps abandoned derelicts that the Factors\nrecovered and restored. Once again this has led some\nto believe that the Factors are using what to them are\nprimitive craft in order to hide their real technology,\nwhile others are of the opinions that the Factors are\nsimply scavengers and opportunists, piggybacking on\nthe developments of other alien species.\nOne interesting feature of Factor technology is that\nthey use no artificial intelligences.

It is uncommon for them to\nrisk direct interactions. It should be kept in mind that\nFactors are cautious to the point of being conservative\nand view transhumanity as potentially hostile or\ndangerous, so they are more likely to act with discretion\nthan boldness. Factors are also quite cunning,\nhaving evolved from prey-capturing predators, and\nstill design complex machinations (traps in the metaphorical\nsense) to achieve their goals. In other words,\nFactors out to achieve something are likely to hatch an\n%378\nelaborate plot to get it and are not against recruiting\ntranshumans. Also, drawing on their abilities to self-modify\nthemselves and technology developed on their\nown or picked up at other places in the universe, they\ncan adapt to new situations very quickly.\nsubsubsectionAlien Mindset\nFactors don't possess Lucidity stats and cannot be\ndriven to madness like transhumans.\nAffecting Factors with psi is very difficult, as noted\non p. 222. As of yet, Factors have not exhibited any\npsi abilities of their own.\nsubsubsectionFactor Combat \nFactors usually avoid direct combat but can defend\nthemselves if they have to. They are only likely to act\naggressively in situations where they have surprise,\nenvironmental or technological advantages, and/or\nsuperior numbers. Due to their cooperativism, Factors\nare rarely encountered alone, working en masse\nto eliminate potential threats.\n<strong>Immunity to Kinetic Damage: </strong>Due to their gooey\ncomposition and non-differentiated physiology, kinetic\nweapons (firearms, railguns) are not very damaging\nto Factors. Most such projectiles pass through their\ngelatinous bodies, inflicting minor damage via hydrostatic\nshock. The holes left by such weapons quickly\nclose in a matter of seconds. Likewise, cuts left by\nblades rapidly seal. In game terms, both such weapons\ninflict the minimum amount of damage possible.\n<strong>Regeneration: </strong>Even if damaged, Factors regenerate\nvery quickly. They heal SOM <em>div</em> 10 (round up) damage\nevery Action Turn. Wounds may not be healed this\nway, however.\nsubsubsectionFactor Computers\nDue to using completely alien protocols and system\ndesigns, Factor computers are essentially impossible\nto hack. They do, however, employ some devices that\nemulate transhuman computer systems for communication\npurposes, and these may be hacked as normal.\nsubsubsectionFactor Dust Toxin\nAs noted above, Factors can deploy a type of chemical\nFactor dust that is is toxic to transhumans. Treat this\nas an area effect (cone) attack. <br/>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Bio <br/>\n<strong>Application:</strong> Inh <br/>\n<strong>Onset Time:</strong> 1 Action Turn <br/>\n<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes (5 with medichines) <br/>\n<strong>Effect:</strong> Severe coughing and respiratory distress, 1d10 damage per Action Turn for 5 Action Turns (or ongoing with continuous exposure), –20 to all actions for 2 hours. Medichines reduce damage by half and modifier duration to 15 minutes.\nsubsubsectionMelding\nIndividual Factors may merge together to form larger\nunits, much like masses of Factors form colonies. In\ngame terms, use the highest stat possessed by the\nmelded Factors, +2 for each additional Factor up to a\nmaximum of +10. Durability (and Wound Thresholds)\nare added together."

The gates are built from some\nsort of stable exotic matter whose full atomic structure\nscientists haven't come close to cracking. To touch\nand sight, however, the gates appear to be constructed\nfrom a timeless-seeming polished black metal with no\nsigns of aging or wear and tear. Something about the\ngates' physical composition makes them difficult to\nlook at, as if the viewer cannot quite focus on their\noutlines. Some onlookers have reported feelings of\nvertigo and nausea, while others have insisted that the\ngate outlines move on the edges of their visions, as if\nthe lines are reflowing or the edges are vibrating at\nhigh frequencies. Due to this disturbing feature, most\ngate sites keep the actual gate structures covered.\nStructurally, the gates themselves are partially\nenclosed by an irregular spherical cage composed of\nblack arms that are bent and angled in unusual ways\nand sometimes interlocking. When new wormhole\nlocation is programmed into the gate, these arms\nphysically change shape, move, and reflow  around\nthe spherical gate area (suggesting they are made of\nsome sort of programmable matter). The openings\nbetween arms are sometimes only large enough for\na transhuman to enter, while others are large enough\nto allow a freight train of supplies to pass through.\nIn many cases, large vehicles or equipment must be\ndismantled, carried through, and reassembled on the\n%%% 380\nother side. It is suspected that the gate size could be\nprogrammable, but so far efforts to do so have failed.\nAll known gates within the solar system are located\non the surface of naturally occurring astronomical\nbodies, be that a planet, moon, asteroid, or so on.\nNone have yet been found without such a land-based\nconnection (e.g., floating in space or in the upper\natmosphere of a gas giant), though such gates have\nbeen found in other star systems. It is speculated that\ngates could be physically moved, but no one is willing\nto risk such an endeavor given the lesson learned\nwhen the Go-nin Group messed too heavily with the\nDiscord Gate's controls (see <em>Eris, </em>p. 109).\nThe arms comprising each gate's spherical cage have\nan abnormal-looking organic-seeming growth on their\nexterior surface in some areas, patterned in entrancing\ntwists, curves, and whorls that in fact adhere to\nperfect mathematical formulas. It took some time for\nscientists to discover that this growth was in fact the\ngate's control systems, or so-called \"black box.\" The\ninterface developed to interact with this system is what\nallows gate controllers to manipulate gate functions."

Anyone or\nanything entering that sphere comes out the other side\nof the wormhole, through a similar gate, seemingly\ninstantaneously. An unknown force field effect seems\nto prevent the atmospheres from the two connected\ngates from interacting.\nExactly how this wormhole is created is something\nthat remains outside of transhumanity's comprehension\nThe generally accepted theory is that each gate\nacts as an anchor, allowing the fabric of space-time\nto be folded so that two such anchored places can\nbe brought together, ripping a hole open between\nthem so that a person can simply step through. It is\nunclear whether or not these wormholes are all preexisting\ncreated when the gate was first established,\nor whether each wormhole is manufactured whenever\nthe gate is activated.\nOther more radical theories on how the gates function\nexist, though these are usually discounted as far\nless likely. One such theory suggests that the wormholes\ncreated are actually only zero-width Planck-scale\nconnections across space-time and that no matter\nis actually transferred—only information. Instead, this\ntheory suggests that anyone or anything entering the\nwormhole is in fact instantaneously scanned and disassembled\nand then their informational blueprint is\ntransmitted as information across space to the other\ngate, which immediately reassembles an exact copy\nusing some sort of powerfully advanced nano- or femtotechnology\nVery little evidence supports this theory,\nhowever, and the disturbing implications it represents\nraises fierce opposition."

Through trial and error—and numerous\nhorrible accidents—the procedures for gate operation\nhave become somewhat normalized and standardized,\nthough unexpected complications are par for the\ncourse.\nEach gate can be programmed to open to numerous\nextrasolar locations.

Given the high casualty and death rates\ninvolved, finding qualified personnel can be difficult.\nThere are more than enough infugees, poor, desperate,\nor thrill-seeking individuals willing to risk their lives\nif give the opportunity, however, no matter what their\nmotivations. Gatekeeper operates a lottery system,\nwhereby willing adventurers can sign up in the hope\nof their name being pulled to be sent on an expedition\nto a foreign point in space. Such gatecrashers must\nsign away all rights to any discoveries they may make\nto Gatekeeper, however, though the corp provides not\ninsignificant rewards for certain discoveries, such as\nkey resources, alien artifacts, or new life. One potent\n%%% 381\nprize has yet to be claimed: finding a living, sapient\nalien life form.\nIn contrast, the Love and Rage anarchist collective\noperating the Fissure Gate on Uranus makes the gate\navailable to anyone who schedules time to use it, assuming\ntheir Rep is good and they aren't acting with\ncommercial interests in mind. Any discoveries made\nvia the Fissure Gate must be openly shared. The drawback\nto using the Fissure Gate is that the anarchists'\nresources are limited. Gatecrashing operations are\nhandled in a DIY manner, meaning that the operators\nmay not be able to provide the support that certain\nexpeditions need.\nResourceful parties may also rent gate time via\nGatekeeper or one of the other hypercorp-controlled\ngates, though this tends to cost a small fortune. The\nmore a group is willing to pay, however, the more time\nand support they will get.\nWhen establishing an opening to a new location,\nseveral precautionary measures are taken. First, the\ngate area itself is evacuated and cordoned off with\na defensive security perimeter, just in case anything\nhostile comes through. Then drones are moved in to\npush a micro fiberoptic camera through the gate to\nview what is on the other side. This is followed by a\nlarger sensor package, evaluating environmental conditions\nIf the environment is not hostile, a tethered\ndrone is then sent through to explore the far gate environs\ntrailing a hardwired connection back through\nthe gate.\nFor gatecrashing expeditions, these procedures are\noften rushed—to the hypercorps operating the gate,\ntime is valuable. Each second wasted on a gatecrashing\nexpedition is one less second they can use establishing\na new colony or exploiting a new world of its\nresources. Indeed, it is common for a connection to be\nclosed when a gatecrashing expedition is sent through,\nto be dialed up at a later scheduled time for retrieval,\nso as not to waste gate operations on an idle connection\nMany a gatecrashing team has failed to check-in\nat their appointed pickup time.\nMost of the gate-controlling entities have established\na system and infrastructure for making regular\nconnections to extrasolar colonies and ferrying machinery\nand supplies through. Often this is handled by\nestablishing very short connections, just enough time\nfor a few people to transfer back and forth and/or to\nsend a trainload of supplies through via tracks that\nrun right up to the gate."

They\nalso were not socialized with transhuman mindsets\nand values as the Prometheans and most AGIs were,\nmeaning that aside from their programmed military\nand defense directives they have adapted most of their\nown self-interests. Given this and their recursively-improved\nintelligence capabilities, it is likely that the\nTITANs are far removed from transhuman interests\nand modes of thinking. It's impossible to say how they\nwould have interacted with transhumanity if history\nhad played out differently, but it is unlikely that they\nwould have considered themselves part of the transhuman\nfamily or even seen fit to remain on friendly/\nsupportive terms with transhumanity.\nThough the TITANs are believed to have left Earth\nat the end of the Fall, no one is quite sure exactly\nwhat happened or why. It is known that the onslaught\nof TITAN mesh attacks suddenly broke off in the\nwake of transhumanity's off-planet exodus, and that\nthe bulk of TITAN activity on Earth and around the\nsystem came to a distinct halt. After the discovery\nof the Pandora Gates, it was widely assumed that\nthe TITANs had constructed these gates and used\nthem to leave the solar system for distant parts of\nthe galaxy, presumably taking billions of uploaded\nminds with them. While some believe—and hope—\nthat the TITANs are gone for good, there are others\nwho worry that they are still here, lingering on Earth\nand hidden away in other niches of the solar system,\nbut in some sort of dormant state, perhaps building\nup to some future onslaught. A few believe that the\nTITANs are indeed gone, but are concerned that that\ntheir attention was simply temporarily diverted and\nthat they will one day return to finish the destruction\nof transhumanity.\nThe truth is that the TITANs did indeed build the\ngates and embark for destinations unknown (though\ngamemasters may of course decide otherwise for their\ngames), but this does not mean that they are all gone.\nSome still linger in hidden places, perhaps trapped and\nwounded during some conflict during the Fall, finishing\nup some unfathomable task, or driven mad by the\nExsurgent virus and left behind by their fellows. It is\nalways possible that others may return, most likely\nto complete some unfinished job or perhaps to lure\ntranshumanity out into the galaxy. It is also possible\nthat transhumans will find traces of the TITANs in\nthe network of exoplanet gates, perhaps even whole\ncommunities of TITANs, pursuing whatever agendas\nthey have in the vastness of space.\nAs with transhumans, the TITANs are not necessarily\nunified. They have different agendas and goals and\nmay very well come into conflict with one another.\nThough all have been corrupted and subverted by the\nExsurgent virus, and so they act according to the ETI's\n%%% 384\nwhims, some of them retain aspects of their original\nminds and do not always fall in step as quickly as the\nothers. Gamemasters can use this to their advantage,\ncreating plots that allow the characters to exploit\ndifferences between the TITANs in order to escape\notherwise deadly or impossible situations.\nIn game terms, the TITANs are not given stats.\nThey are as potent as the gamemaster needs them to\nbe. Like the Prometheans, the TITANs are incapable\nof downloading their full intelligence into physical\nmorphs, though they may puppeteer morphs or create\nlimited delta forks for sleeving purposes. Like the Prometheans\nthey should rarely be used or encountered\ndirectly by the player characters\nWhile the TITANs may no longer be the direct\nthreat they once were, they left behind an arsenal of\nweapons, nanoswarms, and virii that still linger on\nEarth, the Zone on Mars, and various derelict habitats\nand deserted places. Characters venturing into such\nplaces may encounter these as a threat or they may\nneed to work against an outbreak of such dangers in\nan inhabited habitat."

In their standard\nform, fractals resemble a strange sort of metallic\nbush surrounded with an eerie glittering haze. In\ntheir center are a number of metallic branches, linked\ntogether with a flexible joint. Each of these branches\nsplits into two or more smaller branches, also with\nflexible joints. These branches also split, and then split\nagain, and so on down to the molecular scale. The tip\nof each fractal branch ends in a nanoscale manipulator\nFractals are deceptively potent adversaries, having\nthe capability to dismantle almost anything at the\nmolecular level, much like a disassembler nanoswarm\n(p. 329), and also to rebuild anything just like a nanofabricator\n(p. 327). Attacking them with projectiles is\nfutile, as they absorb the ammunition, break it down\ninto its constituent atoms or molecules, and then use\nthose as components to build a weapon to use back\nagainst you.\nFractals can be equipped with any type of gear the\ngamemaster desires—if they don't have something,\nthey can make it.

They may also nanofabricate\nnew materials, much like fractals (p. 382).\nCombined, these capabilities make such nanoswarms\nincredibly potent. When they encounter a new opponent\nthey can scan the opponent's capabilities and\nthen fabricate offensive systems to use against them.\nWhen an opponent deploys a weapon system again the\nswarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that\nwill make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in\nthe future. These nanoswarms may also function like\nso-called utility fog, linking together into a physical\nlattice in order to create large scale physical forms.\nThe possibilities for such nanoswarms are almost limitless\nFor example, they may lie in wait as an invisible\nnanoscopic swarm, float as barely-visible mist, or shape\ninto a swarm of small hopping drones to move about.\nWhen facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform\nitself into a giant electroshock net across the ground,\nshape into a flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or\nlink together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to\nslice through their fleshy foes. Such nanoswarms are\nalso impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need\nto survive in order to rebuild the swarm, and the new\nswarm will learn from the mistakes of the old.\nSelf-replicating nanoswarms follow the rules given\nfor <em>Nanoswarms and Microswarms</em>, p. 328, with the\nfollowing additions and exceptions:\nbeginitemize\n• They do not need to be sustained by a hive and\ndo not deteriorate.\n• They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per\nhalf hour.\n• They may nanofabricate new items, materials,\nor forms in half the standard timeframe (half an\nhour per Cost category).\n• They may replicate any of the nanoswarm functions\nas noted on p. 328, as well as the functions\nof any other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust,\ncovert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).\n• They may make SOM Tests.\n• At the gamemaster's discretion, they may adapt\nnew defenses against attacks used against them.\nNew defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise\nand replicate throughout the swarm, after which\nsuch an attack will inflict minimal or no damage.\n• Assume they have any skill they need at a minimum\nof 40.

As\nthe gamemaster, you determine when and how many\nRez Points to award, following the guidelines below.\nRez Points should be awarded at the end of every\nstory arc, at the break in the action between one adventure\nand the next.

        "title": "Reputation Gain And Loss",
        "html": "In addition to awarding Rez Points, the gamemaster\nshould also adjust each character's Rep scores according\nto actions they took during game play, according to\nthe guidelines below. For simplicity, these can be applied\nat the end of the adventure, though gamemasters who\nseek a more dynamic game could apply changes to the\ncharacters' Rep scores in game, as their peers judge\nthem according to their actions (or lack thereof) and\nnews about them in real time. Rep scores should only\nbe modified according to public actions and interactions\n%%% 387\nthe character has with people capable of pinging their\nRep with positive or negative feedback. Actions that\nhappen in secret, without anyone ever knowing, should\nhave no effect. Likewise, pissing off a Factor or a brinker\nisolate who never communicates with outsiders isn't\ngoing to matter because no one else will ever hear of it\n(unless the character lifelogs it and posts it to the mesh\nlater ... ). Note that Rep modifications only apply to Rep\nscores tied to the character's known identity.\nNote that characters may gain and lose Rep score\nin networks they don't actively participate in. For\nexample, a character with r-rep of 0 may help bring\nout a major scientific discovery that is shared with the\nsolar system's scientific community at large, thus gaining\nthe character a few points of r-rep even though\nthey never hang out with argonauts or scientists—\nwhat matters is that people who access r-rep will find\npositive details when they ping the person's score on\nthat particular rep network.\nCertain actions may result in a character simultaneously\ngaining Rep with one network while losing\nRep in another. For example, an anarchist prankster\nwho embarrasses a major hypercorp figure in public\nwill certainly gain some @-rep points, but their c-rep\nis likely to go down by an equal amount.\nRep changes provide an excellent way for gamemasters\nto include more roleplaying and more interactions\nwith the <em>Eclipse Phase</em> universe in their games. Social\nnetworks are a two-way street, meaning that members\nof the character's social networks might contact them\nfor equipment, favors, and information during game\nplay for things that are completely unrelated to the\nmission the character is on. A character who ignores\nsuch requests risks losing Rep. Fulfilling such requests\nmay gain the character Rep and may also provide\ncomic relief or even plant some plot hooks for the\nnext scenario.\nsubsubsectionReputation Gains\nRep awards are given for characters who help people\nout, benefit a faction, do something creative, make\na major discovery or strides in a particular area of\nactivity, pull off successful publicity stunts, win a\ncompetition, and so on. Some suggested examples are\nnoted here:\n<strong>Trivial Award (1–2 points):</strong> Do a Level 1 favor,\nmake a moderate contribution to free/open source\nprojects, throw a good party, make your sales quota,\ndo the job no one else wants to do.\n<strong>Minor Award (3–4 points):</strong> Do a Level 2 favor, deliver\na kick-ass or moving performance, make a minor\ncontribution to science, win impressively at some\npublic event.\n<strong>Moderate Award (5–6 points):</strong> Do a Level 3 favor,\nmake a serious business score, lead the winning side\nin a decisive engagement, create the meme everyone\ntalks about for a week and then forgets, make the\nnews for something positive, risk serious injury.\n<strong>Major Award (7–8 points):</strong> Do a Level 4 favor,\ndesign the new tool everyone wants, throw an\nimpressive planetoid-scale event, complete an extensive\nproject (1 month work or 1 week of difficult/\nspecialized work), risk death.\n<strong>Extreme Award (9–10 points):</strong> Do a Level 5 favor,\nstart this year's hot fashion trend, make a major scientific\ndiscovery, close the deal on a major corporate acquisition\nstart (or put down) a revolution, complete\na major project (1 year work or 1 month difficult/\nspecialized work), risk true death.\nsubsubsectionReputation Losses\nRep losses are suffered by characters who fail to render\naid when needed, lose professional credibility, make\nmajor or public blunders, doublecross their friends,\nand so on. Some suggested examples are noted here:\n<strong>Trivial Loss (–1 or –2 points):</strong> Fail to do a Level 1\nfavor, inconvenience others, be involved in professional\ndispute, ruin someone's day, never are available.\n<strong>Minor Loss (–3 or –4 points):</strong> Fail to do a Level 2\nfavor, embarrass yourself at a public event, piss off\nsomebody important.\n<strong>Moderate Loss (–5 or –6 points):</strong> Fail to do a Level\n3 favor, endanger someone's physical safety, make\nthe news for something negative, ruin an event for\neverybody.\n<strong>Major Loss (–7 or –8 points):</strong> Fail to do a Level 4\nfavor, screw up a major mission or activity, endanger\nsomeone's life, associate with hated rivals.\n<strong>Extreme Loss (–9 or –10 points):</strong> Fail to do a Level\n5 favor, botch a major mission or activity spectacularly,\nbetray a faction to its rivals or enemies."

        "html": "Thanks to cortical stacks and archived backups, characters\nin <em>Eclipse Phase</em> can recover from death. When\nrestoring a character from an earlier backup, however,\nit is important to be able to know what the state of\nthe character was as of that backup. Any Rez Points\ngained or spent, any character advancements made,\nany key information or memories acquired since that\nbackup was made are lost. This means that in terms of\ngame stats, resorting to an old backup can mean loss\nof a character's hard-earned advancements—that's the\ntrade-off for being effectively immortal.\nSince these changes can have a serious effect on\ngame play, it's important to conduct accurate record-keeping\nThis sort of bookkeeping isn't hard, and\nthere are two ways to do it. The first is to simply\nmake a copy of a the character's record sheet any\ntime a character makes an archived backup, forks off\nan alpha or beta copy, or dies (thus freezing the cortical\nstack backup). Each of these is considered a ``save\npoint.'' In this case, carefully note the date and time\n(both in character and out of character), and what\nthe event was that prompted the backup. Since what\nknowledge a character knows at different points in\ntheir life may be important, you may also want to\nnote what important information they may hold in\ntheir head, as well as what the recent events in their\n%%% 388\nlife were (to help jog your memory later). This way,\nif the character ever reverts back to one of these save\npoints, you have notes not only on their character\nstats, but what they remember.\nAlternately, you can keep a log of all of your\ncharacter's developments, noted by in-character\ndate. These developments would include: Rez Points\nspent or earned, character advancements made, key\ninformation acquired, backups made, alpha or beta\nforks made, and so on. In this case, if the character\ndies and reverts back to an earlier backup, it is easy\nto see what changes need to be \"rolled back\" to get\nback to that previous version of the character. When\nalpha and beta forks are made, you may also want to\nbranch off a separate log for each fork, as their life\nstream may develop differently than from the original\ncharacter they were spun off from.\nbeginquotation\nbeginlarge\n<strong>NPCS AND MOXIE</strong>\nendlarge\n<br/>\nWhen a gamemaster is generating or winging\nNPCs that the characters interact or fight\nwith, the question of Moxie for NPCs must be\naddressed. When it comes to run-of-the-mill\ngrunt NPC characters, we recommend that such\nNPCs don’t be given Moxie. The reasons for this\nare simple. For one, it is one less stat/headache\nfor the gamemaster to keep track of. More importantly,\nhowever, it represents the edge that\nplayer characters have over the nameless mooks\nthey encounter. When it comes to major NPCs,\nhowever—prime antagonists, key allies, etc.—\nthese characters should have their own Moxie\nscore. Because such NPCs play pivotal roles in a\nscenario, it is important for them to be able to\nalter the outcome of events in much the same\nway the player characters can. It also allows a\ngamemaster to counteract an unfortunate roll\nof the dice that might otherwise spoil the big\nclimax you have worked so hard to set up.\nendquotation"

        "title": "Gamemastering Practicalities",
        "html": "<em>Eclipse Phase</em> is a game about a dark future in which\nthe meaning of (trans)humanity and its very survival\nare at stake. In practice, however, your campaign can\ntake on a wide assortment of flavors or even mix\nseveral styles together. There's nothing that says you\nhave to play <em>Eclipse Phase</em> specifically according to\nthe guidelines we set out. This section covers topics\nyou should think about while preparing a campaign\nand running it, to help you do things the way that\nmakes you and your players happiest.\nsubsubsectionGamemaster Responsibilities \nThe gamemaster has certain responsibilities that will\nkeep a game flowing smoothly. The following is a\nshort summary of the basics.\nbeginitemize\n• The gamemaster should be familiar with the whole game. This doesn't mean the rulebook must be memorized. An understanding of the core mechanics is a must, however, as well as knowing where to find other rules quickly, as needed.\n• The gamemaster should have solid notes on the plots and subplots created for each session. Nothing will ensure you prepare better next time like having the players catch you in a major continuity error due to lack of notes.\n• The gamemaster doesn't just set the scene, they play all the non-player characters that populate the universe. Making each NPC convincing, while not messing up a plot or losing the thread of a scene, can be difficult. Notes are your friend.\n• Know when it's time to toss the dice and trust to the game mechanics to resolve a situation and when it's better to ride out a situation through storytelling and dialog. This is an acquired skill.  The more practice you have, the better you'll get.\n• Don't cheat. Your NPCs should not have access to information they've not gained during game play. If you roll terribly for your major antagonist at the height of the story and they fall with a whimper, roll with it. Be flexible and improvise in such situations. Your players are smart and perceptive and will know when you're forcing a situation with unfair tactics. At the same time, they'll also know when you've stepped up and run with the flow—and they'll thank you for it.\nenditemize\nsubsubsectionFundamentals\nIt's possible to stumble into a campaign without ever\nreally making an effort to find out what everyone\nwants, shooting into the darkness and happening to\nscore a bullseye, but it's not a very reliable way to go.\nSuccessful campaigns usually begin with communication\nAs you begin to prepare your campaign, talk to\nyour players. Explain the basics of the <em>Eclipse Phase</em>\nsetting and let them look over the options for characters\nand tell you what they find interesting. Also take\nnote of what they find uninteresting or even repellent,\nso that nobody wastes a lot of time getting set for options\nthat simply won't be enjoyable in play.\nsubsubsectionChallenges To Players \n<em>Eclipse Phase</em> is set in a time of catastrophic troubles\nand looming disasters, and it's full of facts and concepts\nthat may be heady or even uncomfortable to\nsome players—not to mention their characters. One of\nthe fundamental questions for each gaming group is,\nhow much challenge to the players' sense of comfort is\na good idea? There is no single answer, because tastes\nvary. There are groups whose players thrive on a diet\nof culture shock, ideological disorientation, gray areas,\nand difficult ethical choices. They love the moral and\nintellectual battleground gaming can provide, and\nare seldom so happy as when confronted with a\nreally hard, really interesting dilemma. There are also\ngroups whose players thrive on a diet of intellectual\n%%% 389\nengagement, tactical and strategic challenge, and well-developed\nroleplaying that never pushes players'\nbuttons or puts them into harsh no-win situations.\nThere's a whole universe of responses in between these\nstyle sof play and none of them can conceivably be\nright for everyone. What matters to your campaign is\nwhat works for you and your players.\nKeep in mind as you talk about it with your group\nthat more shock doesn't equal more maturity. The\nprime audience for gore in film, for instance, is not\nwell-aged men and women but teenage boys and\nyoung men. Shakespeare's <em>The Tempest </em>is no less\nmature a tale than <em>Macbeth  </em>even though it has a\nhappy ending. It can be easy to confuse endurance\nwith enlightenment, but in fact the two have nothing\nto do with each other. Endurance is about how much\ndescription of visceral nastiness the players can take\n(and deliver), while enlightenment (insofar as it ever\nhappens in gaming) is about what insights players\ntake away from whatever it is that happened in play.\nDon't feel like a wimpy failure if you or your players\nwould rather keep the darker parts of the game world\nsuggested rather than delineated in hard-edged detail,\nsince the point is that it be satisfying rather than it\nbe as horrifying or mind-blowing as possible. The\nconverse is also true: just as more is not better, so less\nis not better if your players do thrive on details. Your\njob as gamemaster includes knowing as much as you\ncan about what it is your players actually prefer in\nthis regard as in others and seeing how you can satisfy\nit in ways that are also satisfying for you.\nThat said, there is one technique you really should\nnever use without very clear permission from your\nplayers, and that's playing on their real-world fears\nand phobias. If you know that one of them is, for\ninstance, genuinely phobic about spiders, you can\ncount on getting some real shivers by adding arachnid\nfeatures to robots and morphs. You can also ruin a\nplayer's enjoyment of the session or the whole campaign\nthat way, if it comes unexpectedly and leads\nto the real-world fear drowning out the experience\nof play. Some players are fine with judicious use of\ntheir vulnerabilities, and others just aren't. Under no\ncircumstances should you poke at weak spots without\nmaking sure you've discussed it first.\nsubsubsectionThe Problem Of Secrets \nUncovering secrets is a big part of this game. There's\na problem, however, in that a lot of the secrets are out\nthere where players can come across them: in this very\nchapter, in reviews of the game, discussion in online\nforums, and so on. As gamemaster, you will need to\ndecide how you want to deal with the potential for\nspoiled revelations.\nAs with so many potential issues, the place to start\nis with your players. Ask them how much it bothers\nthem to know things that their characters are going\nto be finding out in play. Some players do a fine job\nseparating their own knowledge from that of their\ncharacters with mental firewalls. Others have a very\ndifficult time doing so, and knowing things in advance\nas players takes away a lot of the fun of character\ndiscovery for them. In addition, some players have\na good sense of what degree of player-level surprise\nworks best for them, and some don't. Discuss it with\nthem. Tell them that spoilers are available, and that\nyou certainly can't stop them from learning it all, one\nway or another. Ask them how much trouble this may\nbe for them, and then proceed from there. Ask the\nplayers who have more trouble with spoilers to simply\nstay away from early commentary on the game, and\ntell them that you'll let them know when the spoilers\nhave come into play in your own campaign so that\nit's no longer an issue. Ask the other players to work\nwith you in keeping things fresh and fun for those\nplayers, too. In most groups, making it a matter of\ncooperation for the sake of everyone's good time will\ndraw out good responses. (If it doesn't, the group may\nwell have other problems in any event.)\nThere's a related question for both you and your\nplayers. How much do any of you mind when a particular\ncampaign's version of an answer diverges from\nthe stock one provided in print? There are two kinds\nof variation possible for this, and each one raises its\nown issues.\nThere are matters that the game leaves unresolved,\nso that there is no single authoritative answer, like the\nnumber of TITANs in the solar system in the game's\npresent moment. If you choose to give a specific\nnumber, it's your choice, and any number that seems\nto work for your campaign will probably do the job,\n%%% 390\nwhether it's one, three, seven, a dozen, or something\nelse. Your campaign can't diverge from the baseline\nunless your answer is relatively extreme, like ``there\nare no TITANs, it was all a hoax before contact with\nthe Exsurgent virus and then purely alien technology\nafter that.'' In this case, your players can have read\nall the game's secrets and still be surprised by the revelation\nyou present. The potential for trouble here is\nnot a conflict of expectations based on the game, but\nbased on expectations raised in other contexts. Some\ngames, like some movies, TV shows, and other stories,\ndevelop a following with strong ideas of its own about\nwhat the real truths and important matters are, and if\nthe following thrives, its members may end up with\nideas that have less and less to do with the original\ninspiration. This isn't good or bad in itself, but it can\nbe a problem, which is why it bears conscious consideration\nand discussion, both before play and as the\ncampaign evolves. Ask your players to tell you about\nconversations and insights that shape their expectations\nfor the game world and storylines. Sometimes\nyou'll want to work those in with your own plans,\nsometimes you may want to deliberately play against\nthem for the sake of a delightful surprise (generally\nmore delightful for players than characters, but that's\nlife as a character for you). In either case, it's better to\nbe thinking about it than missing it.\nThen there are matters that the game does give\ndefinite answers for, but which you wish to change\nfor the sake of your own campaign's characters and\nstories. This is perfectly fine. There are no game police\nroaming the countryside and forcing you to accept\nanswers you'd prefer not to use. But your players\nwill, as with the first question, have expectations, and\nyour campaign will work better if you make sure you\nunderstand what those expectations are. How much\n<em>would </em>it bother them if it turned out there were no\nTITANs and it was all a hoax, and so on? It's hard to\nguess what friends will say and impossible to predict\nthe range of responses strangers might give, so ask\nthem. (This particular answer is one that's unlikely to\nappear in anyone's campaign, but it makes a handy\nexample for your conversational use precisely because\nit's extreme. So their answers to it are likely to be\nabout the same as to any other potentially extreme\nchange, and this one probably doesn't give away any\nof your own plans.) Some players are flexible on most\nmatters but have particular points of attachment;\nif yours are among them, ask them to explain what\nthose points are for them, so that you can keep them\nin mind. Other players have a hard time having fun\nwith any major shift from published standard answers,\nand if you have players like that, you'll want to know\nit so that you can see how to adapt your plans to\nwork within that framework.\nsubsubsectionThat's What I'm Talking About: Shared Inspiration \nIt's not quite true that everything changed from the\nearly 21st century to <em>Eclipse Phase's</em> universe, but a\ngreat many things did, and it can be hard to keep track\nof them all at once. This is where shared inspirations\ncan come in handy. One striking illustration can convey\na lot of details for both foreground and background,\nsuggesting an aesthetic standard for design, an exotic\nenvironment, people doing futuristic tasks with appropriately\nadvanced tools, and so on. A prose passage\nfrom a rewarding novel may set an ambiance or nail\ndown some aspect of the characters' circumstances.\nThere are potential pitfalls, and it's important to\nbe aware of them. The greatest is obsolescence, the\nmeaning of something evocative changing because\nthe players' reality has changed since the inspiration\nentered it. William Gibson's ground-breaking cyberpunk\nnovel <em>Neuromancer </em>begins, ``The sky above the\nport was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel\nSupporting details make it clear that this is an\nindustrial port at night, the sky gray from pollution\nand flecked with ash and other debris. But that was\nan image published in 1984. A decade and a half later,\nNeil Gaiman pointed out that to his children, the\ncolor of television tuned to a dead channel is bright\nblue, thanks to ubiquitous cable delivery. In another\ndecade, the default color of a station not in use may\nbe something else entirely. The moral is that it's not\nenough to agree that an image is very striking. You'll\nwant to make sure that you all agree on what it is\nabout it that's striking, to avoid a tangle of misconceptions\nthat could derail play later on.\nThe References page (p. 394) offers a wide range\nof immediately relevant inspirations, but it's not the\nfinal word on the subject. If the people in your group\nhave a long-time favorite space scene, or description\nof life in the midst of a high-tech investigation, or\npoetic glimpse of what it might feel like to modify the\nbody in ways not possible in real life, or something\nelse that's stayed with them a long time and seems\nlike it might bear on your campaign, encourage them\nto share. Remember to be courteous with each other's\npersonal treasures, whether you end up using them\nor not; there's nothing like earned trust to encourage\nmore sharing.\nImages can be particularly helpful for what they\nconvey about the world behind and around the\nforeground events. For instance, think of a corridor\non a typical spaceship or habitat in <em>Eclipse Phase. </em>\nDid you imagine it as being a standardized size and\nshape, so that its counterparts elsewhere would be\nvery much the same or a more individualized work\nintended for use just where it is without concern\nfor interchangeability? Did you imagine it as well\nlit even when not in use, lit well when sensors show\npeople present and otherwise dim or dark, or perhaps\nplanned to be well lit but in practice haphazard and\nunreliable thanks to lack of maintenance and funds?\nDid you imagine its surfaces smooth and clean, with\n%%% 391\nequipment, maintenance bays, and the like all behind\nhatches and covers, or was it cluttered and lumpy?\nNone of that matters all the time, but when it comes\nto the investigation of a derelict, the hunt for someone\n(or something) trying to hide, a race against time, or\nother dramatic complication, these things could affect\nyour play, and rather than try to tally all possible contingencies\nin advance, having some general-purpose\nreferences can save everyone time and confusion.\nsubsubsectionThings That Should Not Be: Horror \nThe universe of <em>Eclipse Phase</em> is a time of horrors\nunleashed. Every character has had to come to some\npersonal accommodation with the existence of things\nthat offend our basic expectations of decency and\npracticality all at once. Horror comes in many flavors,\nand no one campaign can make use of all of them.\nThere are at least as many theories of horror as\nthere are people who create horror stories. Everything\nhere is necessarily a generalization. You and your\nplayers can find exceptions to every single point in\nit, and if you like the way those work better, go with\nthem. This discussion is intended to trigger ideas, not\nto close off anything. That said, there are some useful\ngeneralizations about horror, starting with an insight\nexpressed well by H.P. Lovecraft: ``The oldest and\nstrongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest\nand strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.'' All\nhorror can be thought of as built around encounters\nwith the unknown, beginning with the realization that\nthere is something unknown present, learning something\nabout the scope of its nature and activities, and\nthen trying to respond one way or another.\nIn this game, the discovery part is half over. There's\nno question about the presence of the unknown.\nYes, there really are monsters beyond transhuman\nunderstanding loose in the universe, and everyone in\nthe <em>Eclipse Phase</em> universe knows how bad and how\n<em>strange </em>the TITANs could get. Many people also have\nsome idea of how exotic life on the far side of the Pandora\nGates can be. There's no room left for characters\nto respond to some new strangeness with confident\nskepticism, sure that they know the range of what's\npossible and plausible within transhuman experience\nanymore. Almost anything might exist, given the\nfacts of what's already known. Instead, the question\nfor <em>Eclipse Phase </em>people facing a mystery is whether\nthis particular unknown will turn out to be simple\nand straightforward to deal with, more complicated\nbut nonetheless a part of their routine lives like malfunctioning\nmachinery or a sabotaged and unusually\nmodified morph, or something beyond the normal like\na TITAN-programmed weapon or alien life. Sooner or\nlater, if they keep poking around, the characters can\ncount on running into all sorts of unknown and maybe\neven unknowable challenges. Are they there yet?\nHorror is seldom very far from humor. Humor\nserves many roles in human psychology, and one of\nthem is helping us whittle down the mental \"size\" of\nmysteries and threats to something we can deal with.\nFurthermore, horror usually involves a balance of improbable\nelements, with things lined up to go wrong\nin interesting ways, and it doesn't take much for a\nparticular rickety edifice to go from strange and menacing\nto ludicrous. When your players start laughing,\nsometimes the best thing for you to do is to roll with\nit. Laughter can do everyone good, supporting the\n\"play\" part of roleplaying. In addition, some events\nactually are funny or at least can be taken as funny,\neven (sometimes especially) when most of what's going\non is serious. On the other hand, if you really would\nlike to keep a scene serious and the players break out\nin giggles, it's often wise to go ahead and take a break.\nTell the players what you're doing, too; trying to deceive\na group of your friends isn't very reliable and\ncan backfire badly. Make the break long enough for\neveryone to get the giggles out and then continue.\nAt the end of the day, through communication with\ntheir players, the gamemaster will know how much\nhorror their group wishes to encounter. A group may\ndecide that they want to be 100 percent immersed\ninto the various horrors of <em>Eclipse Phase.</em> Another\ngroup, however, may decide that while they enjoy\nthe meshed theme of horror with the other aspects\nof <em>Eclipse Phase,</em> they don't wish it to be a principal\nelement. In such a situation, horror would remain just\nthat, a theme, while the plots woven by the gamemaster\nwould spin around the myriad of other elements\nthat make up the game.\nsubsubsectionTranshumanism\nHumanity has embraced transhumanism for survival,\nharnessing science and technologies to catapult physical\nand mental faculties to super-human levels, while\neradicating involuntary death and enabling near immortality\nthrough the digitization of consciousness\nand the ability to transfer bodies at will. This is one of\nthe cornerstone themes of <em>Eclipse Phase.</em>\nThe technologies inherent to a transhuman future\nraise many questions and ethical issues, however, and\nthese are some of the central themes that <em>Eclipse </em>\n<em>Phase</em> seeks to explore. We encourage both gamemaster\nand players to play around with the possibilities\nand contradictions enabled in such a universe. How\ndo our mindsets change when death no longer looms\nover us? What does identity mean when our bodies\nare disposable and our personalities can be edited?\nAre we the same person when we are revived from\na backup, or sent off as a fork? Are technologies like\nnanofabrication something to be feared and restricted,\neven when they can eliminate poverty and greed?\nHow do we ensure public safety in a world where\ntechnology makes weapons of mass destruction easily\navailable? How do ideas inherent to religious and\nspiritual thought cope with AI, backups, or resleeving\nWhat does it mean to be an uplifted animal in a\nsociety centered on humans? Who decides our future?\nThese are just a few of the issues that <em>Eclipse Phase</em>\nraises, and many of them can be used as the central\ntheme for an entire campaign."
