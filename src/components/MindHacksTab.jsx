While you were out, a message\nfrom Aeneas with a precis on psi, extracted from\nthe infomorph backup of psigeneticist Daborva\n(StellInt, Dipole Research Station on Ganymede),\nwas rerouted for distribution to your Firewall node.\nendquotation\nCoined by the biologist Bertold P. Wiesner,\n“psi” was originally an umbrella term\nused to describe a number of so-called\n“psychic” abilities and other speculative\nparanormal phenomena such as telepathy\nand extra-sensory perception. While\nthe term was used extensively in the\nfield of parapsychology and pop culture\nin the twentieth and early twenty-first\ncenturies, the study of psi was largely\nconsidered a pseudoscience with flawed\nmethodologies and gradually lost funding\nand support.\nDuring the Fall, however, repeated\nrumors and accounts of unexplained\nphenomenon drew the attention of\nscientists, military leaders, and singularity\nseekers alike. Numerous nanovirii had\nbeen unleashed upon transhumanity,\nracing through populations and transforming\nas they spread. Some inflicted\nonly minor biological or mental changes\nand impairments, but many were vicious\nand deadly. The most feared variants,\nhowever, were those that Firewall has\ncome to label as the Exsurgent virus—a\ntransformative nano-plague that mutates\nits victims and subverts them to its will.\nThe Exsurgent virus was also observed\nto radically modify the subject’s neural\npatterns and mental state, affecting synaptic\narrangement and even modulating\nsynaptic currents. These changes alter\nand enhance the victim’s cognition and\nseemed to endow an ability to sense and\neven affect the minds of others from a\nshort distance—an ability dubbed “psi”\nas the causal factors continue to mystify\nus. The existence and nature of this phenomenon\nremains carefully concealed\nand under wraps in controlled habitats,\nso as not to trigger widespread panic.\nAmong anarchist and other open communities,\nknowledge of psi is more widespread,\nbut details are vague and reports\nare generally greeted with skepticism.\nThe Exsurgent virus is exceptionally\nmutable and adaptive, however, and two\nargonaut researchers who were aware of\nand studying it soon made an interesting\ndiscovery. One variant strain of the virus\nwas found that endowed the subject\nwith exceptional mental abilities without\nengaging the transformative process\nof the other strains. Though infection\nstill has other drawbacks, Firewall and\nother agencies have come to regard\nthis strain as “safe” in the sense that\nthe subject does not transmogrify into\nsomething else and their general personality\nremains intact. Intrigued that this\navenue of inquiry might lead to a way\nto nullify the effects of other Exsurgent\nstrains, Firewall and others continue\nto experiment with the strain with the\ncooperation of willing test subjects (or\naccording to some reports, unwilling\nvictims in the case of certain authorities\nand hypercorps)."

        "title": "THE NATURE OF PSI",
        "html": "Labeled the Watts-MacLeod strain\nafter the researchers who isolated it,\nfurther study has gained insight into\nthe effect this virus has on transhuman\nbrains. Careful analysis of infected\nsubjects discovered that their altered\nsynapses generate a modulated brainwave\npattern that is extremely difficult\nto detect. Those “in-the-know” have\ncome to refer to these asynchronous\nbrainwaves as “psi waves,” fitting with\nthe Greek letter designation of other\nbrainwaves (alpha, beta, delta, gamma,\ntheta). Likewise, affected individuals are\nknown as “asyncs.”\nExploration of the explicit causal factors\nbehind psi waves remains stymied.\nTheories regarding extraordinary mental\nprocesses with the ability to change\nquantum states have been explored but\nremain frustratingly inconclusive. Neuroimaging\nand mapping have enabled\nscientists to pinpoint structures within\nthe brain, neural activity, and perturbations\nin the brain’s bioelectric field that\nare associated with psi processes, but\nattempts to duplicate these features\nin non-infected brains have resulted in\nfailure or worse. Attempts to identify\nasyncs by psi brainwave patterns are not\neven assured of success. Numerous dead\nends have prompted many researchers to\npostulate that the mechanics underlying\npsi are simply too strange and too far\nbeyond transhumanity’s understanding\nof physical sciences—perhaps reinforcing\ntheories that the Exsurgent virus is in\nfact of alien origin.\nOne leading speculation is that the\nchanges wrought in the mind by infection\nactually entangle some of the\nneural sub-systems, enable some sort of\nquantum field within the brain, or possibly\ncreate Bose-Einstein condensates\nwithin the brain, allowing for quantum\ncomputation or perhaps hypercomputation.\nThis enhances the async’s mental\ncapabilities to the level provided by\nmodern implants and neuro-mods—and\nsometimes beyond. This does not explain\nthe capabilities of other asyncs, however,\nespecially those used to read or affect\nother biological minds. These abilities\nseem to involve reading brain waves\nfrom a short range or affecting another’s\nmind via direct physical contact with the\ntarget’s bio-electric fields. Of course I can\nonly speculate in accordance with what\nFirewall has uncovered—it is quite possible\nthat certain hypercorps or other factions\nhave made further breakthroughs,\nbut are keeping the information to\nthemselves.\nThe initiation and use of psi talents\nis generally understood to take place on\na subconscious level, meaning that the\nasync is not actively aware of the fundamental\nprocesses that fuel the psi-waves.\nTraining in certain skills, however, allows\nan async to focus on certain tasks and\npsi abilities. These are called “sleights:”\nmnemonic or cognitive algorithms of psi\nuse rooted in the async’s ego.\nThe percentage of the transhuman\npopulation believed to have contracted\nthe Watts-MacLeod strain remains statistically\ninsignificant—less than .001%\nof the population. The vast number of\nasyncs have been recruited by various\nagencies, “disappeared” for study, or\nsimply eliminated as a potential threat.\nTen years after the Fall, Firewall and\nother agencies have come to regard\nWatts-MacLeod infection as comparatively\nsafe, though we remain quite\nwary of unforeseen side effects or other\nhidden dangers. Most of us engaged in\nstudying the phenomenon now consider\nasyncs to be useful as a tool for fighting\nthe Exsurgent virus and other threatsdespite the protests of those who are\nconvinced that asyncs are not in control\nof their own minds and are not to be\ntrusted. As of yet we have encountered\nno cases of Watts-MacLeod infection\nthat have inflicted anything other than\npsi abilities, though there seems to be\nan increased risk for asyncs to succumb\nto other Exsurgent strains should they\nencounter them. There are other risks associated\nwith Watts-MacLeod infection,\nsuch as extreme fatigue and even lethal\nbiofeedback resulting from extensive use\nof psi sleights and a statistically likelihood\nof developing mental disorders due\nto the increased mental stress placed on\nthe async’s mind."

        "title": "ÆTHER JABBER: ASYNCS",
        "html": "# Start Æther Jabber # <br/>\n# Active Members: 2 #\n<strong><em>1</strong></em> Sorry to bother you, but my muse just\nalerted me to this excerpt that was\nsent around to my Firewall team. Is\nthis for real? I’ve heard the talk about\npsi before—enough to be convinced\nthat there’s something to it, even\nif we can’t explain it—but this bit\nabout variant Exsurgent infection is\ntoo much. Are we seriously going to\nbe working with someone who’s a\nknown carrier? And can you shed any\nmore light on how asyncs do their\nmojo? I’m worried now. And since\nyou are connected to the Medeans, I\nthought I’d take the chance and ask.\n<strong><em>2</strong></em> Well, as to the Medeans ... that’s history.\nI am back on the freelancing market\nright now. But no problem, I’ll try and\nexplain. I know it is not easy to grasp.\n<strong><em>1</strong></em> Shiny.\n<strong><em>2</strong></em> Yes, Srit was once infected with a\nstrain of the Exsurgent virus, probably\non Mars near the end of the Fall. I say\n“was” because the Watts-MacLeod\nstrain seems to go dormant shortly\nafter it finishes rewiring the victim’s\nbrain; the plague nanobots die off and\nget flushed out of the system, unlike\nother Exsurgent strains, which continue\nto stick around and transform\nthe subject. At least, that’s the dominant\ntheory—I’ve also seen some\nspeculation that async minds might\nbe modified so that they continue to\nproduce bio-nanobots that linger in\nthe brain, though what function these\nserve remains unclear. However, the\nprevailing opinion among our best\nneuroscientists is that people like Srit\nare safe and non-infectious once the\nvirus has run its course. I’ll even go\na bit further and say that prevailing\nopinion is that they can be trusted,\nassuming they don’t catch another\ninfection ... which they unfortunately\nseem to be a bit prone too. Not everyone\nagrees of course, but we have an\nabundance of paranoia in our circles.\nSo far, we haven’t seen any evidence\nthat any of our asyncs have been\nturned by that initial infection, and the\nutility and usefulness of having psiactives\non our side has simply been\ntoo important to push aside.\nAll right. I can’t say that I’ll trust her,\nbut I’ll try and give her the benefit of\nthe doubt. I’ll be damned if I’m going\nto trust an async that’s not vouched\nfor by Firewall though—who knows\nwhat the hell a hypercorp like Skinthetic\nmight be cooking up in their\nblack labs.\n<strong><em>2</strong></em> That seems like a wise choice.\n<strong><em>1</strong></em> Maybe you can put my mind at ease\nby explaining to me in a bit more\ndetail how Watts-MacLeod infection\noccurs.\n<strong><em>2</strong></em> Well, like the other Exsurgent strains\nyou are unfortunately familiar with,\nthe primary transmission vector is a\nnanovirus, but we speculate that it\nmay also be transmitted as a digital\ncomputer virus or possibly even as\na basilisk hack. The physical plague\nform is spread by highly-advanced\ntechno-organic nanobots that infect\na biomorph and use bio-mimicry\nmechanisms to pass as normal cells\nand penetrate the blood-brain barrier\nand central nervous system. The\nnanobots are several steps beyond\nanything our technology can produce,\nare very difficult to detect, and can\noverwhelm most defensive countermeasures.\nInfected minds are essentially\nrewired, and these changes will\nbe copied when the ego is uploaded.\nSynthmorphs and infomorphs remain\nimmune to this nano-infection, but\nthey are theoretically vulnerable to\nother transmission vectors.\n<strong><em>1</strong></em> I’ve heard that synthmorphs are effectively\ninvulnerable to psi as well. This\ntrue?\n<strong><em>2</strong></em> Yes. As far as we can tell, async\nabilities only effect biological\nminds—either their own or others.\nAnd they can only read/affect others\nfrom a very short distance, requiring\nphysical contact in most cases. The\nhalf-biological minds of pods are also\nvulnerable, though to a lesser extent.\nLikewise, asyncs need a biological\nbrain to use their abilities—they\ncan’t use their psi if sleeved in a synthmorph\nand have difficulty in a pod.\n<strong><em>1</strong></em> Interesting. So, I have to ask again—\nyou’re sure she’s safe? I’ve heard\nthat some of these asyncs can be real\nnut-jobs.\n<strong><em>2</strong></em> I’ve heard from several of these\nasyncs directly. The fact is, infection\nrewrites their brain, and some of\nthem came out the other side feeling\nfundamentally altered. Either they\nfelt like a different person, or they\nfelt like there was something new\nthat was part of them—something\nthat they didn’t necessarily like. One\ndescribed it as presence, another as\na black void that whispered at them.\nYet another described it as giving a\npersonality to their unconscious mind,\nwhich only made the gulf between\nunconscious and conscious mind all\nthe more intimidating. Some of them\npreferred to suicide and revert to a\npre-infection backup. While they may\nbe more prone to cracking up as a\nresult, I haven’t ever heard one talk\nabout their abilities as something\nthey couldn’t control.\n1 Well, that’s fucking cheery. There’s\nnothing else we have on how this psi\nstuff actually works?\n<strong><em>2</strong></em> Unfortunately, we don’t. Even the\nPrometheans haven’t been much\nhelp. There are theories, of course, but\nnothing that we’ve been able to verify\nwith rigorous experimentation. It\ndoesn’t help that the factions that are\naware of psi’s existence don’t exactly\ncompare notes—they’re all too busy\nlooking into ways to weaponize it\nand use it against each other, instead\nof figuring out how to use it for the\nbenefit of transhumanity.\n<strong><em>1</strong></em> Of course. The TITANs didn’t get us,\nbut we can still get ourselves. It worries\nme that the best we’ve come up\nwith is nothing.\n<strong><em>2</strong></em> It’s important to keep perspective.\nTranshumanity has come quite a\ndistance and made some impressive\naccomplishments, but our understanding\nof the universe is still in its infancy.\nWhat we may be facing here is something\nconcocted by an intelligence so\nfar beyond our own that we are but\ninsignificant insects in comparison.\nIt likely has a grasp on the universe\nthat is simply beyond our ability to\nunderstand. We shouldn’t be cocky\nand think that we can decipher any\nmystery thrown at us ... we should\ninstead be very, very afraid.\nThough neuroscience has ascended to impressive\npinnacles, allowing minds to be thoroughly scanned,\nmapped, and emulated as software, the transhuman\nbrain remains a place that is complicated, not fully\nunderstood, and thoroughly messy. Despite a prevalence\nof neural modifications, meddling with the seat\nof consciousness remains a tricky and hazardous\nprocedure. Nevertheless, psychosurgery—editing the\nmind as software—remains common and widespread,\nsometimes with unexpected results.\nLikewise, even as the knowledge of neuroscientists\ngrows on an exponential basis, some are discovering\nthat minds are far more mysterious than they had ever\nimagined. During the Fall, scattered reports of “anomalous\nactivity” by individuals infected by one of the\nnumerous circulating nanoplagues were discounted\nas fear and paranoia, but subsequent investigations\nby black budget labs has proven otherwise. Now, toplevel\nconfidential networks whisper that this infection\ninflicts intricate changes in the victim’s neural network\nthat imbue them with strange and inexplicable abilities.\nThe exact mechanism and nature of these abilities\nremains unexplained and outside the grasp of modern\ntranshuman science. Given the evidence of a new\nbrainwave type and the paranormal nature of this\nphenomenon, it is loosely referred to as “psi.”"

        "html": "In Eclipse Phase, psi is considered a special cognitive\ncondition resulting from infection by the mutant—and\nhopefully otherwise benign—Watts-Macleod strain\nof the Exsurgent virus (p. 367). This plague modifies\nthe victim’s mind, conferring special abilities. These\nabilities are inherent to the brain’s architecture and\nare copied when the mind is uploaded, allowing the\ncharacter to retain their psi abilities when changing\nfrom morph to morph.\nsubsubsectionPREREQUISITES\nTo wield psi, a character must acquire the Psi trait (p.\n147) during character creation. It is theoretically also\npossible to acquire the use of psi in game via infection\nby the Watts-MacLeod strain; see The Exsurgent\nVirus, p. 362.\nPsi ability is considered an innate ability of the\nego and not a biological or genetic predisposition of\nthe morph. While psi researchers do not understand\nhow it is possible to transfer this ability via uploads,\nbackups, and farcasting, it has been speculated that\nall components of an async’s ego are entangled on a\nquantum level, or that they possess the ability to entangle\nthemselves or form a unique conformation or\nalignment as a whole even after they have been copied,\nup-, or downloaded. This speculated entanglement\nprocess is also thought to be the origin of the impairment\nthat asyncs experience when adapting to a new\nmorph (see below).\nsubsubsectionMORPHS AND PSI\nAsyncs require a biological brain to draw on their\nabilities (the brains of uplifted animals count). An\nasync whose ego is downloaded into an infomorph or\nfully computerized brain (synthmorphs) has no access\nto their abilities as long they remain in that morph.\nAsyncs inhabiting a pod morph may use psi, but\ntheir abilities are restricted as pod brains are only\npartly biological. Pod-morphed asyncs suffer a –30\nmodifier on all tests involving the use of psi sleights\nand the impact from using sleights would be doubled.\nsubsubsectionMORPH ACCLIMATIZATION\nAsync minds undergo extra difficulty adjusting to new\nmorphs. For 1 day after the character has resleeved,\nthey will suffer the effects of a single derangement\n(p. 210). The gamemaster and player should choose a\nderangement appropriate to the character and story.\nMinor derangements are recommended, but at the\ngamemaster’s discretion moderate or major derangements\nmay be applied. No trauma is inflicted with\nthis derangement.\nsubsubsectionMORPH FEVER\nAsyncs find it irritating and traumatizing to endure life\nas an infomorph, pod, or synthmorph for long periods\nof time. This phenomenon, known as morph fever,\nmight cause temporary derangements and trauma to\nthe asyncs’ ego, possibly even to the grade of permanent\ndisorders. If stored or held captive as an active\ninfomorph (i.e. not in virtual stasis), the async might\ngo insane if not psychologically aided by some sort of\nanodyne program or supporting person during storage.\nIn game terms, asyncs take 1d10 <em>div</em> 2 (round up)\npoints of mental stress damage per month they stay\nin a pod, synthmorph or infomorph form without\npsychological assistance by a psychiatrist, software,\nor muse.\nsubsubsectionPSI DRAWBACKS\nThere are several drawbacks to psi ability:\nbeginitemize\n• The variant Exsurgent strain that endows psi ability\nrewires the character’s brain. An unfortunate side\neffect to this change is that asyncs acquire a vulnerability\nto mental stress. Reduce the async’s Trauma\nThreshold by 1.\n• The mental instability that accompanies psi infection\nalso tends to unhinge the character’s mind.\nAsyncs acquires one Mental Disorder negative trait\n(p. 150) for each level they have of the Psi trait\nwithout receiving any bonus CP. The gamemaster\nand player should agree on a disorder appropriate\nto the character. This disorder may be treated over\ntime, according to normal rules (see Mental Healing\nand Psychotherapy, p. 215).\n• Characters with the Psi trait are also vulnerable to\ninfection by other strains of the Exsurgent virus.\nThe character suffers a –20 modifier when resisting\nExsurgent infection (p. 362).\n• Critical failures when using psi tend to stress the\nasync’s mind. Each time a critical failure is rolled\nwhen making a sleight-related test, the async suffers\na temporary brain seizure. They suffer a –30 modifi\ner and are incapable of acting until the end of the\nnext Action Turn. They must also succeed in a WIL\n+ COG Test or fall down.\nenditemize\nsubsubsectionPSI SKILLS AND SLEIGHTS\nTranshuman psi users can manipulate their egos and\notherwise create effects that can often be neither\nmatched nor mimicked by technological means. To use\nthese abilities, they train their mental processes and\npractice cognitive algorithms called sleights, which\nthey can subconsciously recall and use as necessary.\nSleights fall into two categories: psi-chi (cognitive\nenhancements, p. 223) and psi-gamma (brainwave\nreading and manipulation, p. 225). Psi-chi sleights are\navailable to anyone with the Psi trait (p. 147), but psigamma\nsleights are only available to characters with\nthe Psi trait at Level 2. In order to use these sleights,\nthe async must be skilled in the Control (p. 178), Psi\nAssault (p. 183), and/or Sense skills (p. 184), as appropriate\nto each sleight.\nsubsubsectionROLEPLAYING ASYNCS\nAny player who chooses to play an async should keep\nthe origin of their abilities in mind: Watts-MacLeod\nstrain infection. The character may not be aware of\nthis source, but they undoubtedly know that they underwent\nsome sort of transformation and have talents\nthat no one else does. If unaware of the infection, they\nhave likely learned to keep their abilities secret lest\nthey be ridiculed, attacked, or whisked away to some\nsecret testing program. Learning the truth about their\nnature could even be the starting point of a campaign\nand/or their introduction to Firewall. If they know the\ntruth, however, the character must live with the fact\nthat they are the victim of a nanoplague likely spread\nby the TITANs that may or may not lead to complications,\nside effects, or other unexpected revelations in\ntheir future.\nGamemasters and players should make an effort\nto explore the nature of this infection and how the\ncharacter perceives it. As noted previously, asyncs are\noften profoundly-changed people. The invasive and\nalien aspect of their abilities should not be lost on\nthem. For example, an async might conceive of their\npsi talents as a sort of parasitic entity, living off their\nsleights, or they might feel that using these powers\nputs them in touch with some sort of fundamental\nsubstrate of the universe that is weird and terrifying.\nAlternately, they could feel as if their personality was\nmelded with something different, something that\ndoesn’t belong. Each async is likely to view their situation\ndifferently, and none of them pleasantly."

        "title": "USING PSI",
        "html": "Using psi—i.e., drawing on a certain sleight to procure\nsome kind of effect—does not always require a\ntest. Each sleight description details how the power\nis used.\nsubsubsectionACTIVE PSI\nActive psi sleights must be “activated” to be used.\nThese sleights usually require a skill test. Sleights that\ntarget other sentient beings or life forms are always\nOpposed Tests, while others are handled as Success\nTests. The level of concentration required to use these\nsleights varies, and so may call for a Quick, Complex,\nor Task Action. Active sleights also cause strain (p.\n223) to the async. Most psi-gamma sleights fall into\nthis category.\nsubsubsectionPASSIVE PSI\nPassive psi sleights encompasses abilities that are considered\nautomatically active and subconscious. They\nrarely require an action to be activated and require\nno effort or strain by the psi user. Passive sleights typically\nadd bonuses to various activities or allow access\nto certain abilities rather than calling for some kind of\nskill test. Most psi-chi sleights fall into this category.\nsubsubsectionPSI RANGE\nSleights have a Range of either Self, Touch, or Close.\nSelf: These sleights only affect the async.\nTouch: Sleights with a Touch range may be used\nagainst other biological life, but the async must have\nphysical contact with the target. If the target avoids\nbeing touched, this requires a successful melee attack,\napplying the touch-only +20 modifier. This attack\ndoes not cause damage, and is considered part of the\nsame action as the psi use.\nClose: Close sleights involve interaction with other\nbiological life from a short distance. The optimal distance\nis within 5 meters. For each meter beyond that,\napply a –10 modifier to the test.\nPsi vs. Psi: Due to the nature of psi, sleights are\nmore effective against other psi users. Sleights with\na range of Touch may be used from a Close range\nagainst another async. Likewise, a sleight with a Close\nrange may be used at twice the normal distance (10\nmeters) when wielded on another async.\nsubsubsectionTARGETING\nSynthmorphs, bots, and vehicles may not be targeted\nby psi sleights, as they lack biological brains. Pods\n- with brains that are half biological and half computer -\nare less susceptible and receive a +30 modifier\nwhen defending against psi use. Note that infomorphs\nmay never be targeted by psi sleights as psi is not effective\nwithin the mesh or simulspace.\nMultiple Targets: An async may target more than\none character with a sleight with the same action, as\nlong as each of them can be targeted via the rules\nabove. The psi character only rolls once, with each of\nthe defending characters making their Opposed Tests\nagainst that roll. The psi character suffers strain (p.\n223) for each target, however, meaning that using psi\non multiple targets can be extremely dangerous.\nAnimals and Less Complex Life Forms: Psi works\nagainst any living creature with a brain and/or\nnervous system. Against partially-sentient and partially-\nuplifted animals, it suffers a –20 modifier and\nincreases strain by +1. Against non-sentient animals,\nit suffers a –30 modifier and increases strain by +3. It\nhas no effect on or against less complex life forms like\nplants, algae, bacteria, etc.\nFactors and Aliens: At the gamemaster’s discretion,\npsi sleights may not work on alien creatures at all, depending\non their physiology and neurology. If it does\nwork, it is likely to suffer at least a –20 modifier and\n+1 strain.\nsubsubsectionOPPOSED TESTS\nPsi that is used against another character is resisted\nwith an Opposed Test. Defending characters resist with\nWIL x 2. Willing characters may choose not to resist.\nUnconscious or sleeping characters cannot resist.\nIf the psi-wielding character succeeds and the defender\nfails, the sleight affects the target. If the psi user\nfails, the defender is unscathed. If both parties succeed\nin their tests, compare their dice rolls. If the psi\nuser’s roll is higher, the sleight bypasses the defender’s\nmental block and affects the target; otherwise, the\nsleight fails to affect the defender’s ego.\nsubsubsectionTARGET AWARENESS\nThe target of a psi sleight is aware they are being\ntargeted any time they succeed on their half of the\nOpposed Test (regardless on whether the async\nrolls higher or not). Note that awareness does not\nnecessarily mean that the target understands that psi\nabilities are being used on them, especially as most\npeople in Eclipse Phase are unaware of psi’s existence.\nInstead, the target is simply likely to understand that\nsome outside influence is at work, or that something\nstrange is happening. They may suspect that they\nhave been drugged or are under the influence of some\nstrange technology.\nTargets who fail their roll remain unaware.\nsubsubsectionPSI FULL DEFENSE\nLike full defense in physical combat (p. 198), a defender\nmay spend a Complex Action to rally and concentrate\ntheir mental defenses, gaining a +30 modifier\nto their defense test against psi use until their next\nAction Phase.\nsubsubsectionCRITICALS\nIf the defender rolls a critical success, the character\nattempting to wield psi is temporarily locked out of\nthe target’s mind. The psi user may not target that\ncharacter with sleights until an appropriate “reset”\nperiod has passed, determined by the gamemaster.\nIf the async rolls a critical failure, they suffer temporary\nincapacitation as their mind dysfunctions in some\nharsh and distressing ways (see Psi Drawbacks, p. 221).\nIf a psi user rolls a critical success against a defender,\nor the defender rolls a critical failure, double\nthe potency of the sleight’s effect. In the case of psi attacks,\nthe DV can be doubled or mental armor can be\nbypassed. Alternately, when using Psi Assault (p. 183),\nthe targeted character may be in danger of infection\nby the Watts-Macleod strain (p. 362).\nsubsubsectionMENTAL ARMOR\nThe Psi Shield sleight (p. 228) provides mental armor,\na form of neural hardening against psi-based attacks.\nLike physical armor, this mental armor reduces the\namount of damage inflicted by a psi assault.\nsubsubsectionDURATION\nPsi sleights have one of four durations: constant, instant,\ntemporary, or sustained.\nConstant: Constant sleights are always “on.”\nInstant: Instant sleights take effect only in the\nAction Phase in which they are used.\nTemporary: Temporary sleights last for a limited\nduration with no extra effort from the async. The\ntemporary duration is determined by the async’s WIL\n<em>div</em> 5 (round up) and is measured in either Action Turns\nor minutes, as noted. Strain for the sleight is applied\nimmediately when used, not at the end of the duration.\nSustained: Sustained sleights require active effort\nto maintain for as long as the async wants to keep\nit active. Sustaining a sleight requires concentration,\nand so the async suffers a –10 modifier to all other\nskill tests while the sleight is sustained. The async\nmust also stay within the range appropriate to the\nsleight, otherwise the sleight immediately ends. More\nthan one sleight may be sustained at a time, with a\ncumulative modifier. Strain for the sleight is applied\nimmediately when used, not at the end of the duration.\nAt the gamemaster’s discretion, sleights that are\nsustained for long periods may incur additional strain.\nsubsubsectionSTRAIN\nThe use of psi is physically (and sometimes psychologically)\ndraining to a psi user. This phenomenon is\nknown as strain, and manifests as fatigue, exhaustion,\npain, neural overload, cardiovascular stress, and\nadynamia (loss of vigor). Though strain has only\nrarely been known to actually kill an async, the use\nof too much active psi can be life-threatening in some\ncircumstances.\nIn game terms, every active sleight has a Strain\nValue of 1d10 <em>div</em> 2 (round up) DV. Every active sleight\nlists a Strain Value Modifier that modifies this amount.\nFor example, a sleights with a Strain Value Modifier\nof –1 inflicts (1d10 <em>div</em> 2) –1 DV.\nIf the damage points suffered from strain exceed\nthe character’s Wound Threshold, they may inflict a\nwound just like other damage (see Wounds, p. 207).\nbeginquotation\n<strong>EXAMPLE</strong>\n<br/>\nMatric is investigating a disappearance, so he\ndecides to use his Qualia sleight to boost his\nIntuition while hunting for clues. That psi-chi\nsleight takes only a Quick Action to initiate and\nrequires no test. Matric’s WIL is 25, so the duration\nof this temporary sleight is 5 Action Turns\n(25 <em>div</em> 5 = 5). The sleight’s Strain modifier is –1,\nso he is facing (1d10 <em>div</em> 2) –1 DV. He rolls a 1, so\nhe takes no strain at all!\nLater on, Matric finds himself in a life-or-death\nstruggle with a kidnapper. Lucky for Matric,\nthey’re in a melee, so he’s close enough to try\nand touch his opponent. On his Action Phase, he\nmakes an Unarmed Combat Test with a +20 modifi\ner (for a touch-only attack) and succeeds. This\nallows him to try and use his Psychic Stab sleight.\nHe rolls his Psi Assault of 57 against the target’s\nWIL x 2 (32). His target is in a worker pod morph,\nhowever, which is less susceptible to psi, so he\nreceives a +30 modifier (32 + 30 = 62). Matric\nrolls a 32 and the worker pod a 64—Matric wins!\nFor damage, he rolls 1d10 + (WIL <em>div</em> 10). His WIL\nis 25, so that’s 1d10 + 3. He rolls a score a 7 and\ninflicts 10 (7 + 3) points of damage. The worker\npod screams in pain, suffering a wound from the\npsychic assault.\nendquotation"

        "title": "PSI-CHI SLEIGHTS",
        "html": "Psi-chi sleights are async abilities that speed up cognitive\ninformatics (internal information processing) and\nenhance the user’s perception and cognition.\nsubsubsectionAMBIENCE SENSE\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nThis sleight provides the async with an instinctive\nsense about an area and any potential threats nearby.\nThe async receives a +10 modifier to all Investigation,\nPerception, Scrounging, and Surprise Tests.\nsubsubsectionCOGNITIVE BOOST\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\nThe async can temporarily elevate their cognitive\nperformance. In game terms, Cognition is raised by 5\nfor the chosen duration. This boost to Cognition also\nraises the rating of skills linked to that aptitude.\nsubsubsectionDOWNTIME\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Task (min. 4 hours) <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Sustained <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> 0 <br/>\nThis sleight provides the async with the ability\nto send the mind into a fugue-state regenerative\ndowntime, during which the character’s psyche is\nrepaired. The async must enter the downtime for\nat least 4 hours; every 4 hours of downtime heals\n1 point of stress damage. Traumas, derangements,\nand disorders are unaffected by this sleight. For\nall sensory purposes, the async is catatonic during\ndowntime, completely oblivious to the outside\nworld. Only severe disturbances or physical shock\n(such as being wounded or hit by a shock weapon)\nwill bring the async out of it.\nsubsubsectionEMOTION CONTROL\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nEmotion Control gives the async tight control\nover their emotional states. Unwanted emotions\ncan be blocked out and others embraced. This has\nthe benefit of protecting the async from emotional\nmanipulation, such as the Drive Emotion sleight or\nIntimidation skill tests. The async receives a +30\nmodifier when defending against such tests.\nsubsubsectionENHANCED CREATIVITY\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nAn async with Enhanced Creativity is more imaginative\nand more inclined to think outside the box.\nApply a +20 modifier to any tests where creativity\nplays a major role. This level of ingenuity can\nsometimes seem strange and different, manifesting\nin odd or creepy ways, especially with artwork.\nsubsubsectionFILTER\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nFilter allows the async to filter out out distractions\nand eliminate negative situational modifiers from\ndistraction, up to the gamemaster’s discretion.\nsubsubsectionGROK\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Instant <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\nBy using the Grok sleight, the async is able to\nintuitively understand how any unfamiliar object,\nvehicle, or device is used simply by looking at and\nhandling it. If the character succeeds in a COG x 2\nTest, they achieve a basic ability to use the object,\nvehicle, or device, no matter how alien or bizarre.\nThis sleight does not provide any understanding of\nthe principles or technologies involved—the psi user\nsimply grasps how to make it work. If a test is called\nfor, the psi user receives a +20 modifier to use the\ndevice (this bonus only applies to unfamiliar devices,\nand/or tests the character is defaulting on—it does not\napply to devices the character is familiar with).\nsubsubsectionHIGH PAIN THRESHOLD\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nThis sleight allows the async to block out, ignore, or\notherwise isolate pain. The async reduces negative\nmodifiers from wounds by 10.\nsubsubsectionHYPERTHYMESIA\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nHyperthymesia grants the async a superior autobiographical\nmemory, allowing them to remember the\nmost trivial of events. A hyperthymestic async can be\nasked a random date and recall the day of the week\nit was, the events that occurred that day, what the\nweather was like, and many seemingly trivial details\nthat most people would not be able to recall.\nsubsubsectionINSTINCT\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nInstinct bolsters the async’s subconscious ability to\ngauge a situation and make a snap judgment that\nis just as accurate as a careful, considered decision.\nFor Task Actions that involve analysis or planning\nalone (typically Mental skill actions), the async may\nreduce the timeframe by 90% without suffering a\nmodifier. For Task Actions that involve partial analysis/\nplanning, they may reduce the timeframe by 30%\nwithout penalty.\nsubsubsectionMULTITASKING\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nThe async can handle vast amounts of information\nwithout overload and can perform more than one\nmental task at once. The character receives an extra\nComplex Action each Action Phase that may only be\nused for mental or mesh actions.\nsubsubsectionPATTERN RECOGNITION\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nThe character is adept at spotting patterns and correlating\nthe non-random elements of a jumble—related\nitems jump out at them. This is useful for translating\nlanguages, breaking codes, or find clues hidden among\nmassive amounts of data. The character must have\na sufficiently large sample enough time to study, as\ndetermined by the gamemaster. This might range from\na few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman language\nto a few days of investigating inscriptions left\nby long-dead aliens to a week or more of researching\na lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by\nreading or listening to them being spoken. Apply a\n+20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation,\nResearch, or cod-breaking Tests (note that this\ndoes not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to\ndecrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to\nmore easily learn new languages, reducing the training\ntime by half.\nsubsubsectionPREDICTIVE BOOST\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nThe Bayesian probability machine features of the\nasync’s brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing\ntheir ability to estimate and predict outcomes of\nevents around them as they unfold in real-time and\nupdate those predictions as information changes.\nIn effect, the character has a more intuitive sense\nfor which outcomes are most likely. This grants the\ncharacter a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve\npredicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters\nthe async’s decision-making in combat situations by\nmaking the best course of action more clear, and so\nprovides a +10 bonus to both Initiative and Fray Tests.\nsubsubsectionQUALIA\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\nThe async can temporarily increase their intuitive\ngrasp of things. In game terms, Intuition is raised by\n5 for the chosen duration. This boost to Intuition also\nraises the rating of skills linked to that aptitude.\nsubsubsectionSAVANT CALCULATION\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nThe character possesses an incredible facility with\nintuitive mathematics. They can do everything from\ncalculate the odds exactly when gambling to predicting\nprecisely where a leaf falling from a tree will land\nby observing the landscape and local wind currents.\nThe character specializes in calculation involving the\nactivity of complex chaotic systems and so can calculate\nanswers that even the fastest computers could not,\nincluding things like patterns of rubble distribution\nfrom an explosion. However, this mathematic facility\nis largely intuitive, so the character does not know the\nequations they are solving, they merely know the solution\nto the problem.\nThis sleight also provides a +30 modifier to any\nskill tests involving math (which the character is calculating,\nnot a computer).\nsubsubsectionSENSORY BOOST\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –2 <br/>\nAn async uses this sleight to increase their natural or\naugmented sensory perception (sight, audio, smell,\naugmented) by enhanced cerebral processing, granting\na +20 bonus modifier on sensory-based Perception\nTests.\nsubsubsectionSUPERIOR KINESICS\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nThe async acquires more insight into people’s emotive\nsignals, gestures, facial expressions, and body\nlanguage when it comes time to predict the person’s\nemotional state, intent, or reactions. Apply a +10\nmodifier to Kinesics Skill Tests.\nsubsubsectionTIME SENSE\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\nAn async with this ability can slow down his perception\nof time, making everything appear to move\nin slow motion or at reduced speed. In game terms,\nthis sleight grants the async a Speed of +1. This extra\nAction Phase, however, can only be spent on mental\nand mesh actions.\nsubsubsectionUNCONSCIOUS LEAD\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +0 <br/>\nThis sleight allows the async to override their consciousness\nand let their unconscious mind take point.\nWhile in this state, the async’s conscious mind is only\ndimly aware of what is transgressing, and any memories\nof this period will be hazy at best. The advantage\nis that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and\nso the async’s Speed is boosted by +1. The character\nremains aware and active, but is incapable of complex\ncommunication or other mental actions and is\nmotivated by instinct and primitive urges more than\nconscious thought. Though it is recommended that\nthe player retain control of their character while using\nUnconscious Lead, the gamemaster should feel free to\ndirect the character’s actions as they see fit."

        "html": "Psi-gamma sleights deal with contacting (reading\nand communicating) and influencing the function of\nbiological minds (egos within a biomorph, but also\nincluding animal life). Psi-gamma is only available to\ncharacters with Level 2 of the Psi trait.\nMost psi-gamma use is handled as an Opposed Test\nbetween the async and the target (p. 222).\nsubsubsectionALIENATION\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Psi Assault <br/>\nAlienation is an offensive sleight that create a sense of\ndisconnection between an ego and its morph—similar\nto that experienced when resleeved into a new body.\nThe ego finds their body cumbersome, strange, and\nalien, almost like they are a prisoner within it. If the\nasync beats the target in an Opposed Test, treat the\ntest as a failed Integration Test (p. 272) for the target.\nThis effect lasts for the sleight’s duration.\nsubsubsectionCHARISMA\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Minutes) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Control<br/>\nThe async uses this sleight to influence the target’s\nmind on a subconscious level, so that the target perceives\nthem to be charming, magnetic, and persuasive.\nIf the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they\ngain a +30 modifier on all subsequent Social Skill\nTests for the chosen duration.\nsubsubsectionCLOUD MEMORY\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Minutes) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Control<br/>\nCloud Memory allows the async to temporarily disrupt\nthe target’s ability to form long-term memories. If\nthe async wins the Opposed Test, the target’s memorysaving\nability is negated for the duration. The target\nwill retain short-term memories during this time, but\nwill soon forget anything that occurred while this\nsleight was in effect.\nsubsubsectionDEEP SCAN\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Sustained <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +1 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Sense<br/>\nDeep Scan is a more intrusive version of Thought\nBrowse (p. 228), made to extract information from the\ntargeted individual. If the Opposed Test succeeds, the\nasync telepathically invades the target’s mind and can\nprobe it for information. For every 10 full points of MoS\nthe async achieves on their test, they retrieve one piece\nof information. Each item takes one full Action Turn to\nretrieve, during which the sleight must be sustained. The\ntarget is aware of this mental probing, though they will\nnot know what information the async acquired.\nsubsubsectionDRIVE EMOTION\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Control<br/>\nThis sleight allows the async to stimulate cortical areas\nof the target’s brain related to emotion. This allows\nthe async to induce, amplify, or tone down specific\nemotions, thereby manipulating the target. If the async\nbeats the target in an Opposed Test, they will act in accordance\nwith the emotion for the duration and under\ncertain circumstances may suffer from certain penalties\n(up to +/–30), as determined by the gamemaster. For\nexample, an async might receive a +30 Intimidation\nTest modifier against a target imbued with fear.\nsubsubsectionEGO SENSE\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Close <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Sense<br/>\nEgo Sense can be used to detect the presence and\nlocation of other sentient and biological life forms\n(i.e., egos) within the async’s range. To detect these\nlife forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, opposed\nby each life form within range. The async may\nsuffer a modifier for detecting small animals and\ninsects, similar to the modifier applied for targeting\nthem in ranged combat (see p. 193); likewise, a\nmodifier for detecting larger life forms may also be\napplied. If successful, the async has detected that the\nlife form is nearby. Every 10 full points of MoS will\nascertain another piece of information regarding the\ndetected life: direction from async, approximate size,\ntype of creature, distance from async, etc. The async\nwill know if the target moves, if they do so during the\nsleight’s duration.\nsubsubsectionEMPATHIC SCAN\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Close <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Sustained <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –2 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Sense<br/>\nEmpathic Scan enables the async to sense the target’s\nbase emotions. If the async wins the Opposed Test,\nthey intuitively feel the target’s emotional current state\nfor as long as the sleight is sustained. At the gamemaster’s\ndiscretion, this knowledge may provide a modifier\n(up to +30) for certain Social skill tests.\nsubsubsectionIMPLANT MEMORY\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Instant <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Control<br/>\nAn async using this sleight can implant a memory\nof up to an hour’s length inside the target’s mind.\nThis memory very obviously does not belong to the\ntarget—there is no way they will confuse it for one\nof their own. The intent is not to fake memories, but\nto place one of the async’s memories in the target’s\nmind so that the target can access it just like any other\nmemory. This can be useful for “archiving” important\ndata with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspective,\nor simply making a “data dump” for the target\nto peruse. Implant Memory requires an Opposed Test\nagainst unwilling participants. At the gamemaster’s\ndiscretion, particularly traumatic memories might\ninflict mental stress on the recipient (p. 215).\nsubsubsectionIMPLANT SKILL\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Control<br/>\nSimilar to Implant Memory, this sleight allows the\nasync to impart some of their expertise and implant it\ninto the target’s mind. For the duration of the sleight,\nthe target benefits when using that skill. If the async’s\nskill is between 31 and 60, the target receives a +10\nbonus. If the async’s skill is 61+, the target receives\na +20 bonus. Implant Skill requires an Opposed Test\nagainst unwilling participants. In some cases, the\ntarget has been known to use the skill with the async’s\nflair and mannerisms.\nsubsubsectionMIMIC\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Close <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Instant <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Sense<br/>\nIn a setting where changing your body and face is\nnot unusual, people learn to recognize habits and\npersonality quirks more often. The async must use\nthis sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test.\nIf successful, the async acquires an “imprint” of the\ntarget’s mind that they can take advantage of when\nimpersonating that ego. The async then receives a +30\nbonus on Impersonation Tests when mimicking the\ntarget’s behavior and social cues.\nsubsubsectionMINDLINK\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Sustained <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +1/target after first <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Control<br/>\nMindlink allows two-way mental communication\nwith a target. This may be used on more than one\ntarget simultaneously, in which case the async can act\nas a telepathic “server,” so that everyone mindlinked\nwith the async may also telepathically communicate\nwith each other (via the async, however, so they\noverhear). Language is still a factor in mindlinked\ncommunications, but this barrier may be overcome by\ntransmitting sounds, images, emotions, and other sensations.\nMindlink requires an Opposed Test against\nunwilling participants.\nsubsubsectionOMNI AWARENESS\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Close <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Minutes) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Sense<br/>\nAn async with Omni Awareness is hypersensitive to\nother biological life that is observing them. During\nthis sleight’s duration, the async makes a Sense Test\nthat is opposed by any life that has focused their attention\non them within the sleight’s range; if successful,\nthe async knows they are being watched, but not\nby whom or what. It does, however, apply a +30 Perception\nbonus to spot the observer. This sleight does\nnot register partial attention or fleeting attention, or\nsimple perception of the async, it only notices targets\nwho are actively observing (even if they are concealing\ntheir observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a\ntail, as well as finding potential mates in a bar.\nsubsubsectionPENETRATION\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Quick <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Instant <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> 1 per AP point <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Psi Assault <br/>\nPenetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with\nany offensive sleight that involves the Psi Assault skill.\nIt allows the async to penetrate the Psi Shield of an opponent\nby concentrating their psi attack. Every point\nof Armor Penetration applied to a psi attack inflicts\n1 point of strain. The maximum AP that may be applied\nequals the async’s Psi Assault skill divided by 10\n(round down).\nsubsubsectionPSI SHIELD\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nPsi Shield bolsters the async’s mind to psi attack and\nmanipulation. If the async is hit by a psi attack, they\nreceive WIL <em>div</em> 5 (round up) points of armor, reducing\nthe amount of damage inflicted. They also receive a\n+10 modifier when resisting any other sleights.\nsubsubsectionPSYCHIC STAB\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Instant <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Psi Assault <br/>\nPsychic Stab is an offensive sleight that seeks to inflict\nphysical damage on the target’s brain and nervous\nsystem. Each successful attack inflicts 1d10 + (WIL <em>div</em>\n10, round up) damage. Increase the damage by +5 if\nan Excellent Success is scored.\nsubsubsectionSCRAMBLE\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Passive <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Automatic <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Self <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Constant <br/>\nScramble allows the async using the sleight to hide\nfrom another async using the Ego Sense or Omni\nAwareness sleights. Apply a +30 modifier to the defending\nasync’s Opposed Test.\nsubsubsectionSENSE BLOCK\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Psi Assault <br/>\nSense Block disables and short circuits one of the target’s\nsensory cortices (chosen by the async), interfering\nwith and possibly negating a specific source of sensory\ninput for the chosen duration. If the async beats the\ntarget in the Opposed Test, the target suffers a –30\nmodifier to Perception Tests with that sense equal (doubled\nto –60 if the async scores an Excellent Success).\nsubsubsectionSPAM\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Temp (Action Turns) <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Psi Assault <br/>\nThe sleight allows the async to overload and flood one\nof the target’s sensory cortices (chosen by the async),\nspamming them with confusing and distracting sensory\ninput and thereby impairing them. If the async\nwins the Opposed Test, the target suffers a –10 modifi\ner to all tests the duration of the sleight (doubled to\n–20 if the async scores an Excellent Success).\nsubsubsectionSTATIC\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Close <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Sustained <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> None<br/>\nThe async generates an anti-psi jamming field, impeding\nany use of ranged sleights within their range. All\nsuch ranged sleights suffer a –30 modifier. This sleight\nhas no effect on self or touch-range sleights.\nsubsubsectionSUBLIMINAL\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Instant <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> +2 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Control<br/>\nThe Subliminal sleight allows the async to influence\nthe train of thought of another person by implementing\na single post-hypnotic suggestion into the mind\nof the target. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the\nrecipient will carry out this suggestion as if it was\ntheir own idea. Implanted suggestions must be short\nand simple; as a rule of thumb, the gamemaster may\nonly suggestions encompassed by a short sentence\n(for example: “open the airlock,” or “hand over the\nweapon”). At the gamemaster’s discretion, the target\nmay receive a bonus for resisting suggestions that are\nimmediately life threatening (“jump off the bridge”)\nor that violate their motivations or personal strictures.\nSuggestions do not need to be carried out immediately,\nthey may be implanted with a short trigger condition\n(“when the alarm goes off, ignore it”).\nsubsubsectionTHOUGHT BROWSE\n<strong>PSI TYPE:</strong> Active <br/>\n<strong>ACTION:</strong> Complex <br/>\n<strong>RANGE:</strong> Touch <br/>\n<strong>DURATION:</strong> Sustained <br/>\n<strong>STRAIN MOD:</strong> –1 <br/>\n<strong>SKILL:</strong> Sense<br/>\nThought Browse is a less-intrusive form of mind\nreading which scans the target’s surface thoughts for\ncertain “keywords” like a particular word, phrase,\nsound, or image chosen by the async. Rather than digging\nthrough the target’s ego as with the Deep Scan\nsleight, Thought Browse merely verifies whether a\ntarget has a particular person, place, event, or thing\nin mind, which can be used by a savvy investigator to\ndraw conclusions without the need to invade the mind\ndirectly. Thought Browse may be sustained, allowing\nthe async to continue scanning the target’s thoughts\nover time. The async must beat the target in an Opposed\nTest for each scanned item."

        "html": "Given the reach of neuroscience in the time of\nEclipse Phase, it is easy to think of the mind as\nprogrammable software, as something that can be\nreverse-engineered, re-coded, upgraded, and patched.\nTo a large degree, this is true. Aided by nanotechnology,\ngenetics, and cognitive science, neuroscientists\nhave demolished numerous barriers to understanding\nthe mind’s structure and functions, and even\nmade great leaps in unveiling the true nature of\nconsciousness. Genetic tweaks, neuro-mods, and\nneural implants offer an assortment of options for\nimproving the brain’s capabilities. The transhuman\nmind has become a playground—and a battlefield.\nNanovirii unleashed during the Fall infected millions,\naltering their brains in permanent ways, with\noccasional outbreaks still occurring a decade later.\nCognitive virii roam the mesh, plaguing infomorphs\nand AIs, reprogramming mind states. An “infectious\nidea” is now a literal term.\nIn truth, mind editing is not an easy, safe, and\nerror-proof process—it is difficult, dangerous, and\noften flawed. Neuroscience may be light years\nahead of where it was a century ago, but there are\nmany aspects of the brain and neural functions\nthat continue to confound and elude even the\nbrightest experts and AIs. Technologies like nanoneural\nmapping, uploading, digital mind emulation,\nand artificial intelligence are also comparatively\nin their infancy, being mere decades old. Though\ntranshumanity has a handle on how to make these\nprocesses work, it does not always fully understand\nthe underlying mechanisms.\nAny neurotech will tell you that mucking around\nin the mind’s muddy depths is a messy business.\nBrains are organic devices, molded by millions of\nyears of unplanned evolutionary development. Each\nis grown haphazardly, loaded with evolutionary\nleftovers, and randomly modified by an unlimited\narray of life events and environmental factors. Every\nmind features numerous mechanisms—cells, connections,\nreceptors—that handle a dizzying array\nof functions: memory, perception, learning, reasoning,\nemotion, instinct, consciousness, and more. Its\nsystem of organization and storage is holonomic,\ndiffused, and disorganized. Even the geneticallymodifi\ned and enhanced brains of transhumans are\ncrowded, chaotic, cross-wired places, with each\nmind storing its memories, personality, and other\ndefining features in unique ways.\nWhat this means is that though the general architecture\nand topography of neural networks can\nbe scanned and deduced, the devil is in the details.\nTechniques used to modify, repair, or enhance one\nperson’s mind are not guaranteed equal success\nwhen applied to another’s brain. For example, the\nprocess by which brains store knowledge, skills, and\nmemories results in a strange chaining process where\nthese memories are linked and associated with other\nmemories, so attempts to alter one memory can\nhave adverse affects on other memories. In the end,\nminds are slippery and dodgy things, and attempts\nto reshape them rarely go as planned."

        "title": "THE PROCESS OF PSYCHOSURGERY",
        "html": "Psychosurgery is the process of selective, surgical alteration\nof a transhuman mind. It is a separate field from\nneural genetic modification (which alters genetic code),\nneuralware implantation (adding cybernetic or biotech\ninserts to the brain or nervous system), or brain hacking\n(software attacks on computer brains, neural inserts, and\ninfomorphs), though they are sometimes combined.\nPsychosurgery is almost always performed on a\ndigital mind-state, whether that be a real-time emulation,\na backup, or a fork. In most cases, the subject’s\nmind-state is copied via the same technology and process\nas uploading or forking, and run in a simulspace.\nThe subject need not be willing, and in these cases\nthe subject’s permissions are restricted. Numerous\npsychosurgery simulspace environments are available,\neach custom-designed for facilitating specific psychosurgical\ngoals and programmed with a thorough\nselection of psychotherapy treatment options.\nThe actual process of psychosurgery breaks down\ninto several stages. First is diagnosis, which can\ninvolve the use of several neuro-imaging techniques\non morphed characters, mapping synaptic connections,\nand building a neurochemical model. It can\nalso involve complete psychological profiling and\npsychometric behavioral testing, including personality\ntests and simulspace scenario simulations. Digital\nmind-states can be compared to records of people\nwith similar symptoms in order to identify related\ninformation clusters. This analysis is used to plan\nthe procedure.\nThe actual implementation of psychosurgical alteration\ncan involve several methods, depending on\nthe desired results. Applying external modules to the\nmind-state is often the best approach, as it doesn’t\nmeddle with complicated connections and new inputs\nare readily interpreted and assimilated. For treatments,\nmental health software patches compiled from\ndatabases of healthy minds are matched, customized,\nand applied. Specialized programs may be run to\nstimulate certain mental processes for therapeutic\npurposes. Before an alteration is even applied, it may\nfirst be performed on a fork of the subject and run at\naccelerated speeds to evaluate the outcome. Likewise,\nmultiple treatment choices may be applied to time-accelerated\nforks this way, allowing the psychosurgeon\nto test which is likely to work best.\nNot all psychosurgery is performed for the subject’s\nbenefit, of course. Psychosurgery can be used to interrogate\nor torture prisoners, erase memories, modify\nbehavior, or inflict crippling impairments. It is also\nsometimes used for legal punishment purposes, in\nan attempt to impair criminal activity. Needless to\nsay, such methods are often brute-forced rather than\nfine-tuned, ignoring safety parameters and sometimes\nresulting in detrimental side effects.\nbeginquotation\n<strong>SOLARCHIVE SEARCH: “THE HUMAN COGNOME PROJECT” </strong>\n<br/>\nThe Human Cognome Project was an\nacademic research venture to reverse\nengineer the human brain, paralleling\nin many ways the Human Genome\nProject and its success in deciphering\nthe human genome. The HCP was a\nmultidisciplinary undertaking, relevant\nto biology, neuroscience, psychology,\ncognitive science, artificial intelligence,\nand philosophy of mind.\nFunded and supported by scientific\nand corporate entrepreneurs and early\ntranshumanist groups, the HCP developed\nthe fundamentals of digitizing an ego\nand was a major driving force towards\nthe first transhumans with elevated\nintelligence and brain capacity. The HCP\nhas also been instrumental in cataloging\ntranshuman minds and developing\ndatabases of “mind patches” based on\nthe mind-states of healthy individuals for\ntreating mental diseases and damage.\nThough most HCP data is available to the\npublic, some argonauts claim that certain\ndata is held hostage by some hypercorps,\npotentially for the development of proprietary\nmind-altering technologies.\nAfter the Fall, the remnants of this\nproject were acquired by the Planetary\nConsortium.\nendquotation"

        "html": "In game terms, psychosurgery is handled as a Task\nAction requiring an Opposed Test. The psychosurgeon\nrolls Psychosurgery skill against the target’s WIL x 3.\nApply modifiers as appropriate from the Psychosurgery\nModifiers table.\nIf the psychosurgeon succeeds and the subject fails,\nthe psychosurgery is effective and permanent. The\nalteration becomes a permanent part of the subject’s\nego, and will be copied when uploaded (and sometimes\nwhen forking).\nIf both sides succeed but the psychosurgeon rolls\nhigher, the psychosurgery is effective but temporary. It\nlasts for 1 week per 10 points of MoS.\nIf the subject rolls higher, or if the psychosurgeon\nfails their roll, the attempt does not work.\nThe timeframe listed for psychosurgical procedures\nis according to the patient’s subjective point of view.\nSince most subjects are treated in a simulspace, time\nacceleration may drastically reduce the amount of\nreal-time such a procedure requires (see Defying Nature’s\nLaws, pp. 240–241).\nsubsubsectionMENTAL STRESS\nPsychosurgery is a modification to the transhuman\nmind, and sometimes to the actual person that resides\nin that mind. It is unsurprising then that psychosurgery\nplaces stress on the subject’s mental state and\nsometimes even inflicts mental traumas.\nEach psychosurgery option lists a Stress Value\n(SV) that is inflicted on the subject regardless of\nthe tests’ success or failure. If the psychosurgeon\nachieves an Excellent Success (MoS 30+), this stress\nis halved (round down). If the psychosurgeon rolls\na Severe Failure (MoF 30+), the stress is doubled.\nAlternately, a Severe Failure could result in unintended\nside effects, such as affecting other behaviors,\nemotions, or memories.\nIf a critical success is rolled, no stress is applied at\nall. If a critical failure is rolled, however, an automatic\ntrauma is applied in addition to the normal stress.\nSome psychosurgery conditions may also affect the\nSV, as noted on the Psychosurgery Modifiers table."

This means that players should make a\nreal effort to integrate any such mental modifications\ninto their character’s words and actions, and gamemasters\nshould ensure that a character’s portrayal\nplays true to their mind edits. Some psychosurgical\nmods can be reflected with ego traits, while others\nmight incur modifiers to certain tests or in certain\nsituations.

At the gamemaster’s discretion, other\nmind-editing procedures may be attempted, using\nthese as a guideline.\nbeginquotation\n<strong>PSYCHOSURGERY MODIFIERS</strong>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbegintabularlll\nSITUATION & PSYCHOSURGERY TEST MODIFIER & SV MODIFIER <br/>\nImproper Preparatory Diagnosis & –30 & +1 <br/>\nSafety Protocols Ignored & +20 & x2 <br/>\nSimulspace Time Acceleration & –20 & +2 <br/>\nSubject is an AI, AGI, or uplift & –20 & +1 <br/>\nendtabular\nendquotation\nsubsubsectionBEHAVIORAL CONTROL\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> 1 week <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> Limit/Boost –10; Block/Encourage –20, Expunge/Enforce –30 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> (1d10 <em>div</em> 2, round up) <br/>\nCommonly used for criminal rehabilitation, behavioral\ncontrol attempts to limit, block, or expunge a\nspecific behavior from the subject’s psyche. For example,\na murderer may be conditioned against acts of aggression,\nor a kleptomaniac might be restricted from\nstealing. Some people seek this adjustment willingly,\nsuch as socialite glitterati who restrict their desire to\neat, or an addict who cuts out their craving for a fix.\nBehavioral control can also be applied as an unleashing\nor reinforcement. A companion may desire\nto eliminate their sexual inhibitions, for example, or\na hypercorp exec may boost his commitment to place\nwork above all else.\nA character will simply feel compelled to avoid\na behavior that is limited (perhaps suffering a –10\nmodifier), but will find it quite difficult to pursue a behavior\nthat is blocked (requiring a WIL x 3 Test, and\nsuffering a –20 modifier). They will find themselves\ncompletely incapable of initiating a behavior that is\nexpunged, and if forced into the behavior will suffer\na –30 modifier and (1d10 <em>div</em> 2, round up) points of\nmental Stress.\nLikewise, a character will feel compelled to pursue a\nbehavior that is boosted, and will find it hard to avoid\nengaging in a behavior that is encouraged (requiring a\nWIL x 3 Test to avoid). They will have no choice but\nto engage in enforced behaviors, and will suffer (1d10\n<em>div</em> 2, round up) points of mental Stress if prevented\nfrom doing so.\nsubsubsectionBEHAVIORAL MASKING\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> 1 week <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> –20 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> 1d10 <em>div</em> 2, round up <br/>\nGiven the ability to switch bodies, many security and\nlaw enforcement agencies have resorted to personality\nand behavioral profiling as a means of identifying\npeople even when they resleeve. Though such systems\nare far from perfect, someone’s unconscious habits\nand quirks could potentially give them away. Characters\nwho wish to elude identification in this way may\nundergo behavioral masking, which seeks to alter and\nchange the character’s unconscious habits and social\ncues. Apply a +30 modifier when defending against\nsuch identification systems and Kinesics Tests.\nsubsubsectionDEEP LEARNING\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> Skill Learning Time <em>div</em> 2 <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> +20 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> 1 <br/>\nUsing tutorial programs, memory reinforcement protocols,\nconditioning tasks, and deep brain stimulation,\nthe subject’s learning ability is reinforced, allowing\nthem to learn new skills more quickly.\nsubsubsectionEMOTIONAL CONTROL\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> 1 week <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> Limit/Boost –10; Block/Encourage –20, Expunge/Enforce –30 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> (1d10 <em>div</em> 2, round up) + 2 <br/>\nSimilar to behavioral control, emotional control seeks\nto modify, enhance, or restrict the subject’s emotional\nresponses. Some choose these modifications willingly,\nsuch as limiting sadness in order to be happier, or\nencouraging aggression in order to be more competitive.\nMercenaries and soldiers have been known\nto expunge fear. Follow the same rules as given for\nBehavioral Control.\nsubsubsectionINTERROGATION\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> Variable (gamemaster discretion; 1 week default) <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> +30 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> 1d10 <br/>\nPsychosurgery can be used for interrogative purposes\nvia the application of mental torture and manipulation.\nA successful Psychosurgery Test applies a +30\nmodifier to the Intimidation Test for interrogation.\nsubsubsectionMEMORY EDITING\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> 1 week (2 weeks adding/replacing) <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> –10 (willing) or –30 (forced) <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> (1d10 <em>div</em> 2, round up) <br/>\nBy monitoring memory recall (forcibly invoked if necessary),\npsychosurgeons can identify where memories\nare stored in the brain and target them for removal.\nMemory storage is complex and diffused, however,\nand often linked to other memories, so removing one\nmemory may affect others (gamemaster discretion).\nAdding or replacing memories is a much more complicated\noperation and requires that such memories be\ncopied from someone who has experienced them or\nmanufactured with XP software. Even when successfully\nimplanted, fake memories may clash with other\n(real) memories unless those are also erased.\nsubsubsectionPERSONALITY EDITING\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> 1 week <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> Minor –10; Moderate –20, Major –30 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> (1d10 <em>div</em> 2, round up) + 3 <br/>\nPossibly the most drastic psychosurgery procedure,\npersonality editing involves altering the subject’s core\npersonality traits. The personality factors that may be\nmodified is almost unlimited, including traits such as\nopenness, conscientiousness, altruism, extroversion/\nintroversion, impulsiveness, curiosity, creativity, confidence, sexual orientation, and self-control, among\nothers. These traits may be enhanced or reduced to\nvarying degrees. The effect is largely reflected by roleplaying,\nbut the gamemaster may apply modifiers as\nthey see fit.\nsubsubsectionPSYCHOTORTURE\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> Variable <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> +30 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> 1d10 SV per day <br/>\nPsychotorture is mental manipulation for the simple\nintention of causing pain and anguish, reflected in\ngame terms as mental stress and traumas. Prolonged\ntorture can lead to serious mental disorders or worse.\nsubsubsectionPSYCHOTHERAPY\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> Variable <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> 0 <br/>\nTherapeutic psychosurgery is beneficial for characters\nsuffering from mental stress, traumas, and disorders. A\nsuccessful Psychosurgery Test applies a +30 modifier\nto mental healing tests, as noted on p. 215.\nsubsubsectionSKILL IMPRINTS\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> 1 week per +10 <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> +0 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> 1 per +10 <br/>\nSkill imprinting is the use of psychosurgery to insert\nskill-set neural patterns in the subject’s brain, temporarily\nboosting their ability. Skill imprints are artificial\nboosts, however, degrading at the rate of –10 per day.\nNo skill may be boosted higher than 60.\nsubsubsectionSKILL SUPPRESSION\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> 1 day per –10 <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> –10 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> 1 per +10 <br/>\nSkill suppression attempts to identify where skills are\nstored in the brain and then block or remove them.\nThe subject’s skill is impaired and may be lost entirely.\nsubsubsectionTASPING\n<strong>TIMEFRAME:</strong> 1 day <br/>\n<strong>PM:</strong> +10 <br/>\n<strong>SV:</strong> 1 <br/>\nTasping is the use of deep brain stimulation techniques\nto tickle the mind’s pleasure centers. Though this\nprocedure is often used for therapeutic purposes for\npatients suffering from depression or other mental\nillnesses, the intent with tasping is to overload the\nsubject into a prolonged state of almost unendurable\nbliss. Such stimulation is highly addictive, however, so\ncharacter’s exposed to it for any length of time (over\n1 hour, subjective) are likely to pick up the Addiction\ntrait (p. 148). Some criminal organizations have been\nknown to use tasping addiction and rewards as a\nmeans of controlling those under their thrall."

The project was initially proposed by my\nmentor, Dr. Antonio Pascal, whose team had\nproven the feasibility of Accelerated Life Experience\nTraining (ALET) after a series of pilot\nstudies with two small (N <em> prec </em> 1000) samples.\nWhile it is true that these early pilot studies\nused both older subjects and a lesser amount\nof time dilation, the rationale for the Futura\nProject’s ambitious program was justified by a\nremarked decrease in transhumanity’s population\ndue to the Fall, a system-wide stagnant\npopulation growth rate (blamed on various\nfactors including increased longevity, available\ncontraception, and rising despair over troubling\ntimes), as well as a desire to move aggressively\ninto a new technological sector in the hopes of\nobtaining a competitive advantage.\nFutura began immediately in the wake\nof the Fall with an initial seed population\nof *** test subjects culled from extant genetic\nmaterial and gestated to between 1 week and\n6 months after birth. Of these, less than 10%\nwere live births from either a surrogate or\ngenetic birth mother who had perished during\nthe Fall. The majority came from our Lunar and\nMartian labs and were brought to term within\nan exowomb.\nAfter the sample was selected, all subjects\nwere sleeved into our fast-growth futura-brand\nbiomorph bodies and inducted into customized\nsimulspace accelerated learning environments.\nThe project made extensive use of emergent\ntechnologies and techniques culled from recaptured\nTITAN facilities, including neogenetic\ntraits for the futura morphs and time distortion\napplications for captive simulspace populations.\nFutura ran concurrently on three different\nresearch stations with a combined staff of\n2,211 researchers and support personnel and\n45 AGIs custom-programmed for expert child\ndevelopment. Project goals were to raise each\nchild to a subjective 18 years life experience in\n3 years objective time.\nDespite omnipresent observation and\nreal-time adjusting of the simulspace and educational\nprogramming for optimal normality,\nsomewhere along the way the project suffered\na breakdown in quality assurance and parameter\nmonitoring that resulted in a near total\nfailure at empathy modeling. We first observed\nthis effect 11 months into the project when the\nsubjects had aged to approximately 6 years of\nage. Incidences of animal cruelty and acting\nout had spiked, though at that time they remained\nwithin acceptable standards. Over the\nnext few months this trend continued and Dr.\nPascal authorized the usage of more authoritative\n“parenting” to attempt to correct for the\nborderline sociopathic behavior that was being\nexhibited by 23.19% of all subjects by the 18-\nmonth mark (9 years of age).\nWe now know that these changes had\nthe unintended consequence of suppressing\novert displays of cruelty and violence and\nmerely taught the majority of subjects how\nto conceal their psychoses. It was also at this\ntime that the first deaths occurred. The initial\nwaves were thought to be accidents and\nboth the victim and perpetrator were usually\nbacked up to a week or so of subjective time.\nPost-project analysis now shows that 43.87%\nof our subjects had engaged in at least one\nact of premeditated murder by the 24-month\nmark (12 years of age) and the counseling\nprotocols were only training them how to lie\nmore effectively.\nIt was at this point that myself and Dr.\nAaron Bharani advocated pulling the plug on\nthe project and bringing the subjects out to\nreal time and intensive counseling. Dr. Pascal\nvetoed our concerns without ever taking them\nto the board. As the project spiraled towards\nits conclusion, a fork of Dr. Bharani went public\nat the 34 month mark, inciting a firestorm of\ncontroversy. While Dr. Pascal successfully tied\nup investigators, hoping to see the project\nthrough to its conclusion, the incident at our\nLegacy research station occurred. Initial findings\nconcluded that one or more of the subjects\nhad escaped the program and were in fact\nresponsible for the habitat’s environmental failures\nand the thousands of subsequent deaths.\nIn the face of intense public and private\nscrutiny, many of the partners involved in\nthe project attempted to pull out and even\neliminate all traces of their involvement. In the\nresulting chaos, an estimated *** subjects\nwere quietly released into the system’s general\npopulation. It was only after this occurred that\nall known subjects were identified as having\nbeen infected with the Watts-Macleod strain\nof the Exsurgent virus, though when and how\nthis occurred remains troubling and unclear.\nThough later orders resulted in all remaining\nsubjects being euthanized and/or backed up\ninto cold storage, only of *** the released\nsubjects were recaptured. Of the rest, *** pursued\nsanctuary with sympathetic authorities,\n*** went public and submitted themselves\nto extensive psychotherapy, *** were killed in\nincidents of violence and not resurrected, and\nthe rest presumably went into hiding.\n<em>prec</em> end excerpt <em>succ</em>\nendquotation"
